Last year, U.S. District Judge Charles Breyer in San Francisco said that Walgreens Boots could be held liable for \u201csubstantially contributing\u201d to an opio\u201d d epidemic and faulted Walgreens for its \u201c15-year failure\u201d to properly scrutinize opioid prescriptions and flag possible misuse of the drugs.

The Dow , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for a lower open. Bond yields rise on a hotter weekly jobless claims number. Dallas Fed president says current economic data don't justify an interest rate hike pause in June. Wall Street saw a big rally Wednesday after House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and President Joe Biden said the U.S. won't default. Staff-level debt talks continue. Biden back from his trip to Asia on Sunday. 2. Walmart (WMT) beats on first-quarter earnings and revenue. Advertising sales nice. Grocery very strong. U.S. same-store sales excluding fuel gain well ahead of expectations. Boosts full-year guidance; roughly matches estimates. Q2 outlook short. Dow stock Walmart up more than 1% on the release. 3. Procter & Gamble (PG) cut to hold from buy at Truist, which also takes down price target to $155 per share from $165. The analysts see valuation at peak levels. Club name we talked about Wednesday on our Monthly Meeting for members. It could have further run. Check out our meeting rapid-fire update on all 34 stocks our portfolio. 4. Mizuho analysts join the chorus of people who think that Palo Alto Networks (PANW) is going to have a choppier quarter because of the macro environment. Price target lowered to $220 per share from $235. Still a buy. We own it for the Club and want to ride it out because if rivals Zscaler (ZS), CrowdStrike (CRWD) and Okta (OKTA) were good, PANW should be good when it reports Tuesday. 5. Oppenheimer increases Nvidia (NVDA) price target to $350 per share from $300. AI is having an iPhone moment. H100s, used to run artificial intelligence, are worth more than gold or diamonds right now. You can't do massive cloud management without these cards. Nvida is set to report its quarter on Wednesday after the bell. 6. Citi makes Amazon (AMZN) its top e-commerce pick. The analysts also make fellow Club name Meta Platforms (META) their top pick among the companies working on innovating online advertising. For Meta on the video-form video front, I think TikTok will begin to go away. Montana becomes the first U.S. state of many to ban the Chinese-owned platform. 7. Alibaba (BABA) to spin off its cloud division as a separate, publicly traded company. The Chinese e-commerce titan's quarterly revenue misses. The year got off to a tepid start, reflecting the slower recovery in China's economy post-Covid that we've been seeing in many of our American companies that do business there. 8. Cisco Systems (CSCO) sees big drop in orders so it is all that is focused upon, even as they told you that would happen. Big beats on earnings and revenue. Didn't matter. We exited Cisco two weeks ago. 9. Club holding TJX Companies (TJX) gets multiple price-target boosts on Wall Street after an awesome quarter. Just a great print . Shows the off-price retailer behind the T.J. Maxx, Marshalls and HomeGoods chains can deliver in a slowing economy. Over at Target (TGT), the discount retailer saw a price target cut to $183 per share from $186. The analysts didn't like the gross margin. 10. Deutsche Bank names FedEx (FDX) a short-term buy idea idea ahead of the quarter, due out next month. I totally agree and it will be fabulous. I think this company is a very changed company and can be bought aggressively. See upside to even bullish call. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

[+] Congress Centre in Katowice, Poland on April 24, 2023.  (Photo by Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto via Getty Images)NurPhoto via Getty Images We believe that Amazon stock (NASDAQ NDAQ : AMZN) is a better pick than FedEx stock (NYSE: FDX), given its better prospects. Although AMZN stock trades at a higher valuation of 2.3x trailing revenues, compared to just 0.6x for FedEx FDX , this gap in valuation makes sense, in our view, given Amazon\u2019s AMZN superior revenue growth and financial position, as discussed below. Looking at stock returns, AMZN has fared slightly better with 35% returns this year, while FDX is up 28%, and the broader S&P500 index is up 7%. There is more to the comparison, and in the sections below, we discuss why we believe Amazon will offer higher returns than FedEx in the next three years. We compare a slew of factors, such as historical revenue growth, returns, and valuation, in an interactive dashboard analysis of FedEx vs. Amazon: Which Stock Is A Better Bet? Parts of the analysis are summarized below. 1. Amazon\u2019s Revenue Growth Is Better Amazon\u2019s revenue growth has been better, with a 22.7% average annual growth rate in the last three years, compared to 10.7% for FedEx. The revenue growth over the recent years for both companies was driven by shelter-in-place restrictions and the spread of the Covid-19 virus, resulting in e-commerce growth. Even if we look at the last twelve months, Amazon fares better with sales growth of 9.4% vs. 1.0% for FedEx. Our FedEx Revenue Comparison and Amazon Revenue Comparison dashboards provide more insight into the companies\u2019 sales. Looking forward, Amazon\u2019s revenue is expected to grow faster than FedEx\u2019s over the next three years. The table below summarizes our revenue expectations for the two companies over the next three years. It points to a CAGR of 16% for Amazon, compared to a 5% CAGR for FedEx, based on Trefis Machine Learning analysis. Now, the big e-commerce surge seen through the lockdown phase of the Covid-19 pandemic has now cooled off, resulting in lower ground shipment volume for logistics companies. For perspective, FedEx has seen an 11% fall in average daily package volume for its Express EXPR segment and an 8% fall for its Ground segment for the nine months ending February 2023. Amazon has more revenue streams, including online and physical stores, third-party seller services, subscription services, advertising services, and amazon web services, making it comparatively less vulnerable to a decline in demand. In fact, the company posted better-than-expected results in the first quarter of 2023, with net sales increasing by 9% y-o-y to $127.4 billion. It was due to an 11% rise in the North America segment and a 16% growth in Amazon Web Services revenues. Furthermore, it expects the revenues to remain between $127 billion to $133 billion in Q2 2023, reflecting a 5% to 10% y-o-y growth. That said, it is not all rosy for Amazon. Its key segment - AWS - showed signs of cooling with customers trying to cut costs, and this did not bode well with the investors, who assign a higher weight to this segment, given its superior profitability. Still, it seems that Amazon is poised for more robust growth compared to FedEx in the near term, especially with its advertising business expanding at a fast pace. Note that we have different methodologies for companies negatively impacted by Covid and those not impacted or positively impacted by Covid while forecasting future revenues. For companies negatively affected by Covid, we consider the quarterly revenue recovery trajectory to predict recovery to the pre-Covid revenue run rate. Beyond the recovery point, we apply the average annual growth observed three years before Covid to simulate a return to normal conditions. For companies registering positive revenue growth during Covid, we consider yearly average growth before Covid with a certain weight to growth during Covid and the last twelve months. Annual Growth Forecast - FDX vs. AMZNTrefis 2. FedEx Is More Profitable FedEx\u2019s operating margin has risen from 2.6% in 2019 to 6.6% in 2022, while Amazon\u2019s operating margin increased from 5.8% to 7.2% over this period. However, looking at the last twelve months period, Fedex\u2019s operating margin of 4.7% fares better than 3.8% for Amazon. The decline in operating margin for FedEx can be attributed to higher operational costs, primarily fuel, and declining volumes. Amazon has also seen a rise in operating expenses in the recent past, including its spending on sales and marketing. Our FedEx Operating Income Comparison and Amazon Operating Income Comparison dashboards have more details. FedEx\u2019s free cash flow margin of 9.6% is higher than 8.1% for Amazon. Looking at financial risk, Amazon fares better with its 4.2% debt as a percentage of equity significantly lower than 85.6% for FedEx and its 22.6% cash as a percentage of assets higher than 6.3% for the latter, implying that Amazon has a better debt position and more cash cushion.

The Net of It All We see that Amazon has demonstrated better revenue growth and has a better debt position and cash cushion. This also explains its higher P/S multiple compared to FedEx. Now, looking at prospects, using P/S as a base, due to high fluctuations in P/E and P/EBIT, we believe Amazon is still the better choice of the two, despite its higher P/S multiple. If we compare the current valuation multiples to the historical averages, Amazon fares better, with its stock currently trading at 2.3x trailing revenues vs. the last five-year average of 4.1x. In contrast, FedEx\u2019s stock trades at 0.6x trailing revenues vs. the last five-year average of 0.7x. Our FedEx Valuation Ratios Comparison and Amazon Valuation Ratios Comparison offers more details. The table below summarizes our revenue and return expectations for both companies over the next three years and points to an expected return of 15% for FedEx over this period vs. a 57% expected return for Amazon, based on Trefis Machine Learning analysis \u2013 FedEx vs. Amazon \u2013 which also provides more details on how we arrive at these numbers. Stock Return Forecast - FDX vs. AMZNTrefis While AMZN may outperform FDX in the next three years, it is helpful to see how FedEx\u2019s Peers fare on metrics that matter. You will find other valuable comparisons for companies across industries at Peer Comparisons. Furthermore, the Covid-19 crisis has created many pricing discontinuities, which can offer attractive trading opportunities. For example, you\u2019ll be surprised at how counter-intuitive the stock valuation is for FedEx vs. Amerco.

Learn More Shopify's Q1 earnings call contained a major surprise. The e-commerce landscape is dominated by behemoths like Amazon and Walmart. However, there are a number of rising players that have made inroads. One of them is Shopify (SHOP 0.22%). If you have ever clicked on an advertisement on Facebook or Instagram and subsequently made a purchase, chances are you've checked out using Shopify. During the COVID-19 pandemic, Shopify boomed in popularity. It's no secret that the pandemic was a catalyst for online shopping and the creation of side hustles (monetizing a hobby). During this period, Shopify's offering was in high demand, and subsequently, the financial profile of the company seemingly changed overnight. It should be noted that Shopify's infrastructure is designed for businesses of all sizes, and not just small or medium businesses (SMBs). For example, Tesla uses Shopify as does PepsiCo, LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton, and Nestle. Furthermore, large consulting firms like Deloitte and enterprises such as IBM have strategic agreements with the e-commerce company as systems integrated partners. Like many other businesses, Shopify's operating results have started to normalize in a post-pandemic world and shares are up roughly 70% this year as of the time of this article, although they still are down about 65% from all-time highs in November 2021.  Let's dig into the company's first-quarter results and assess if it's trading at a reasonable valuation and deserves a look for your portfolio. Shopify's Q1 at a glance During Shopify's fourth-quarter 2022 earnings call, management offered the following outlook for the first quarter of 2023: Revenue growth in the high-teen percentages year over year; Gross margins to be slightly higher quarter over quarter. Per the company's Q1 earnings release, Shopify's revenue grew by 25% (and 27% on a constant-currency basis) to $1.5 billion. And its gross margin was 47.5%, up from 46% in Q4.So it's safe to say that Shopify exceeded its own forecast. Another metric to analyze is the company's operating expenses. For the quarter, Shopify's operating expenses totaled $910 million, up 24% year over year. That increase was mainly driven by salaries and wages, including those of the company's Deliverr employees, a business that Shopify is now selling just a year after buying it. While Shopify blew away its revenue forecast, investors should be keenly aware that the company's combined annual growth for cost of goods sold and operating expenses outweighed its revenue growth. For this reason, Shopify reported an operating loss of $193 million, nearly double its operating loss in Q1 2022. Yet despite these operating losses, Shopify reported net income of $68 million, or $0.05 in earnings per share (EPS). By contrast, Shopify reported a net loss of $1.5 billion ($1.17 EPS) for Q1 2022. This was due to a $1.6 billion net unrealized loss on equity and other investments. Shopify owns stakes in other companies, and when these stocks experience volatility in either direction, it must factor those unrealized gains or losses relative to the cost basis for each investment into its bottom line. It should be noted that in Q1 2023, Shopify booked a net unrealized gain of $269 million, more than enough to overcome the operating loss. Overall, these financial results look like a mixed bag to me. I am quite impressed by the revenue growth. However, Q1 clearly illustrated that the Deliverr integration, and its associated costs, were a drag on the core business. After a year of rising costs and slow integration efforts, it's no wonder Shopify decided to pull the plug and divest these logistics assets to Flexport. While Shopify is also undergoing cost reductions in the form of layoffs, I question if a consistent path to profitability is viable. Image Source: Getty Images Didn't see this coming Although Shopify beat Wall Street's expectations, I think the real cause of its post-earnings stock surge was the surprise announcement that the company is selling its logistics assets to Flexport, a leader in that niche. Remember, it was only last May that Shopify acquired logistics and fulfillment company Deliverr. The thesis behind the deal was to layer Deliverr's merchant solutions on top of Shopify's fulfillment network (SFN) infrastructure. But over the last year, management has been updating investors about its integration efforts. Namely, Shopify's management made it clear that the extra costs associated with building out SFN will have a dilutive impact on the company's margin profile. While it may be uncomfortable to admit, Shopify's Q1 results show that it has overhead bloat, driven mainly by added headcount from Deliverr. The divestiture helps Shopify cut labor other non-core operating expenses related to its logistics business. Is the stock a buy? In my opinion, there is more than meets the eye here. When it comes to logistics, Amazon is a juggernaut and it took decades to get there. Plain and simple, Shopify does not have the financial flexibility or the technical know-how to compete. On the surface, selling the logistics assets seems like a smart and responsible move for Shopify. After the earnings call, analysts at several Wall Street institutions, among them Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, Morgan Stanley, and Piper Sandler, revised their price targets for Shopify. Citigroup is the most bullish with a price estimate of $65 per share, implying roughly 8% upside from a recent price of about $60. By contrast, Piper Sandler modeled an intrinsic value of $50 per share, or 17% downside. Goldman and Morgan Stanley have price estimates of $59 and $54 per share, respectively. The common theme among the banks is that all have neutral or neutral-equivalent ratings. Shopify is not yet consistently profitable, which makes traditional valuation metrics such as price-to-earnings or the price/earnings-to-growth ratio less useful. One metric that can help is price-to-sales (P/S). Shopify is currently trading at 13 times its trailing-12-month revenue. P/S ratios vary by industry. But a general rule of thumb is to compare P/S ratios among competitors in the same industry. Given that comparable companies such as Amazon and Walmart are much larger, mature businesses, it's not necessarily fair to judge Shopify's P/S ratio because it's still a growth company, which as a group tend to have high ratios. I personally do not like stocks when momentum is pushing it up. As a long-term investor, I am not looking to buy on perceived good news and sell on an upswing to book a quick gain. The most prudent action for investors is likely to assess Q2 earnings and digest how the Flexport deal is going. While Shopify has built a credible operation, the company faces an uphill battle, particularly with Amazon. There is definitely money to be made in Shopify stock, but its volatility and underlying business fundamentals are enough for me to look elsewhere, and based on the available metrics it's doesn't seem to be trading at a reasonable level.

Learn More Becoming a millionaire takes time, but these stocks can accelerate that timeline. Retiring a millionaire is a goal for many investors, because it is a threshold many feel is necessary to retire comfortably. While it's possible to reach this status with market-tracking funds like ETFs, individual stocks can achieve this goal much faster by picking the correct ones. If that's more your speed, I've got three stocks that I think can supercharge your portfolio returns and help you retire a millionaire someday. CrowdStrike When assessing a company's growth potential, it's essential to consider the future operating environment and if the company could be disrupted. CrowdStrike (CRWD 1.26%) operates in the cybersecurity industry, which is slated to grow significantly over the coming years due to bad actors ramping up attacks. Another buzzword in the tech industry is artificial intelligence (AI), and companies that don't use it will likely be left in the dust. Fortunately for investors, CrowdStrike has a top-notch cybersecurity platform based on AI and can prevent and stop breaches thanks to the trillions of signals it analyzes weekly. Its solution is wildly popular, with its customer base growing by 41% to more than 23,000 in fiscal year 2023 (ended Jan. 31). However, it hasn't captured every possible customer, as only 556 of the Global 2000 and 271 of the Fortune 500 are clients. Existing customers also contribute a lot to growth, the the average customer spending $125 in Q4 for every $100 they spent last year. CrowdStrike also has a huge potential market, and management believes its current offerings constitute a $76 billion total addressable market. However, that figure will rise to $158 billion by 2026 with market growth and planned product launches. Although the company has yet to turn a profit, by other metrics the stock doesn't look all that expensive at 13.5 times sales and 45 times free cash flow. If you're looking for huge upside in a stock, CrowdStrike should be at the top of your list. Taiwan Semiconductor Another cornerstone in stock investing is identifying companies that the market may not appreciate due to short-term conditions. You won't become a millionaire overnight through investing, so taking the long view can reveal some stocks that are genuine bargains. Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM 1.43%) falls into this category, as the slowing semiconductor market has spurred investors pessimism. TSMC is the world's largest chip contract manufacturing company, so it doesn't market its chips. Instead, it makes chips for customers such as Apple\u00a0and Nvidia. With world-leading 3 nanometer (nm) chip technology, it's at the cutting edge of its industry. But, with the PC market affecting every company in the value chain, Taiwan Semiconductor has taken a hit. In Q1, revenue fell 4.8% year over year in U.S. dollars (up 3.6% in local currency). That trend is expected to continue, with analysts predicting revenue to fall by 6% in 2023. However, they forecast revenue growth of 22.2% in 2024. This increase can be attributed to TSMC's 3 nm chip technology finally contributing to the company's top line, as it generated no revenue in Q1. This indicates a significant upside for TSMC, but the stock is trading as if it will never recover. Data source: YCharts TSM PE Ratio Even when its earnings decline during the next 12 months is factored in, Taiwan Semiconductor still trades below where it has over the previous five years. This looks like a strong entry point, and investors should use this short-term weakness to their advantage. MercadoLibre I've discussed a stock that has huge upside and a stock that is undervalued, but what about a company that checks both those boxes? I believe MercadoLibre (MELI -0.05%) fits that description, and investors should pay attention to this one. MercadoLibre is the dominant player in Latin American e-commerce. Its offerings include an online store, shipping logistics, digital payments, and a consumer credit division -- kind of like a combination of Amazon\u00a0and PayPal. This combination has resulted in explosive growth, and Q1 was no exception. Revenue rose 58% on a currency-neutral basis, and operating margin increased by 5 percentage points to 11.2%. Even with MercadoLibre increasing its profitability, the company can still rapidly increase revenue. It also has enormous upside, and Latin America has a large population attempting to break through to the middle class. Fortunately for investors, the stock trades well below its historical valuation range for all of that upside and strong growth. Data source: YCharts MELI PS Ratio MercadoLibre looks like a great buy at these prices, and investors who purchase this stock will position themselves well to become a millionaire with a long enough holding period.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Healthcare AI could become a big growth driver for Google Cloud. Google parent company Alphabet (GOOG 0.85%) (GOOGL 0.79%) is no stranger to artificial intelligence (AI). The technology giant made it a focus years ago, using AI to improve everything from its searches to its offerings to potential advertisers. And just last week, Alphabet wowed investors with its latest AI updates at its annual developer conference. But the company didn't stop there. In fact, Alphabet's announcement at another conference yesterday may signal a major step in a billion-dollar, high-growth part of the AI market. I'm talking about healthcare AI. Alphabet's Google Cloud announced two new solutions that could be game-changers for biotech and pharmaceutical companies. Here's what investors need to know. The key to drug discovery Google Cloud said its Target and Lead Identification Suite and the Multiomics Suite now are both available worldwide. The first product helps scientists predict a protein's structure. This is the key to drug discovery. Once researchers understand a particular protein's structure, they can understand its role in disease. And that makes it easier to develop treatments targeting this protein. The Multiomics suite deals with genomics -- so it could be particularly useful for companies working on personalized medicine or researchers hoping to make new discoveries based on the genome. The suite speeds up the discovery and analysis of data. Researchers can streamline their sharing of data and transform raw sequencing data into insights, for example. The Target and Multiomics suites are game-changers for companies because they address two big challenges for healthcare: the time it takes to bring a product to market and the cost of that lengthy process. Bringing a drug from drawing board to market can take as long as 15 years. And that development process may cost $1 billion or more, according to the British Journal of Pharmacology. These AI tools clearly could speed up the process -- and as a result, lower the costs involved in drug development. Colossal Biosciences has already started using the Multiomics Suite and noted a 52% reduction in costs. And the company said it cut time to complete a whole genome sequence analysis by 88%. Making a difference in healthcare These two elements can make an enormous difference for biotech and pharma companies. They can determine whether a company gets to the market first with a product, for instance. Or they can determine whether a company can afford to develop a particular candidate. Finally, these tools may help reduce drug candidate failures along the development path. That's because, from the earliest days in the lab, researchers will have stronger data -- the data they need to select the best molecules to treat a particular disease. As mentioned, Colossal is already using Google Cloud's new products. And so is big pharma company Pfizer, which is a key client for a couple of reasons. First, Pfizer is a major pharma player, with a market value of more than $200 billion. Second, Pfizer is aggressively working to bring new drugs to market as older blockbusters face the loss of exclusivity -- and as its coronavirus vaccine sales decline. If Google Cloud helps Pfizer score a win by speeding up its drug development, these AI platforms could truly take off. It's important to remember that AI in healthcare isn't a niche market. It could actually be where AI makes one of its biggest marks. On the business side, it may cut costs and time to market. And on the patient side, it may lead to life-saving products. At a compound annual growth rate of 37%, the global AI healthcare market is expected to reach $188 billion by 2030, Statista data show. What does this mean for Alphabet? The company has made a bet on AI across its businesses. And these new developments in healthcare AI could be one of Alphabet's most significant AI steps yet. While growth in Google's advertising revenue has slowed, revenue is on the rise at Google Cloud. The business's revenue advanced 28% in the most recent quarter. Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) still remains the market leader by far. But a focus on healthcare AI might be the element to power Google Cloud's growth moving forward. AWS recently said clients have reined in spending in the current market environment. But, as we look at Google Cloud's new AI platforms, we could imagine healthcare clients possibly increasing their spending. They need to develop new products to grow -- and if AI can help them get there faster and cheaper, it's a worthwhile investment. This may not happen immediately. As drugmakers start to hear about benefits of using the tools, though, Google Cloud may see more and more of them knocking on its door. Of course, Google Cloud isn't the only game in town. AWS, too, is advancing in AI healthcare. But in this early stage of AI, there is room for more than one company to excel. All of this means Alphabet and its investors have a big reason to cheer about the company's latest move in the world of AI.

By Danny Vena \u2013 May 18, 2023 at 6:55AM Key Points Alphabet has been on a tear so far this year, generating five times the gains of the broader market. A depressed advertising market has weighed on its results, but this too shall pass. Additional growth spurred by cloud computing and AI could further boost Alphabet's stock. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOOGL Alphabet Market Cap $1,538B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.92%)\u00a0$1.11 Current\u00a0Price $121.95 Price as of May 18, 2023, 10:50 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The search giant has generated impressive gains thus far in 2023. Could this be just the beginning? Alphabet (GOOGL 0.92%) (GOOG 0.96%) has had a banner year so far in 2023, riding the wave of a broad recovery among technology stocks. Shares of the search giant are up 35% so far this year, roughly five times the 7% gains of the S&P 500. This is in stark contrast to the stock's performance last year, when it lost more than 39%. The other catalyst fueling its gains were the company's better-than-expected financial results, which suggested the beginnings of a recovery for the advertising market. This gave investors much-needed confidence that the macroeconomic headwinds that have weighed on Alphabet's stock might finally be easing. What does this mean for investors who missed out on Alphabet's current rally? Should they buy now with the expectation of further gains, or avoid the stock due to the economic uncertainty that remains? Let's take a look. Image source: Getty Images. What's been weighing on Alphabet stock? There's little question as to what's been driving the broader market over the past year or so: the economy. The broader market downturn was fueled by persistent inflation and rising interest rates. These conditions resulting in a commensurate decline in consumer discretionary spending, which in turn caused businesses to slash expenses. Historically, one of the first items on the income statement to be cut is marketing, because advertising spending can be dialed back or ramped up on short notice without a significant impact on ongoing business operations. This was evident in Alphabet's performance in 2022, as full-year revenue grew just 10%, down 75% from its impressive gains of 41% in 2021. As concerning as that is for investors, it's worth noting that this is merely a temporary situation. History shows that as the economy begins to recover, businesses will resume their traditional spending habits, and the demand for internet advertising will resume. Google remains the worldwide leader in search, controlling a dominant 93% of the market. This in turn fuels its industry-leading position in digital advertising, representing roughly 30% of worldwide digital ad spending, according to marketing trade publication Digiday. This suggests that Alphabet is well-positioned to rally when ad spending resumes. What could drive Alphabet stock higher? In addition to the coming rebound in the advertising market, there are other catalysts that could fuel Alphabet's stock rally. The most obvious is cloud computing. In the 2022 fourth quarter, Google Cloud was the third-largest worldwide cloud infrastructure provider, but controlled just 10% of the market, behind Amazon\u00a0Web Services with 32% and Microsoft\u00a0Azure with 23%, according to a report by market analytics company Canalys. Yet even as cloud spending slowed, Google Cloud was the fastest-growing of the three, with growth of 36%. For context, Azure and AWS grew 31% and 20%, respectively. The report noted that Google's \"differentiated products and focused go-to-market strategy are helping to drive customer momentum.\" If Google Cloud can continue to increase its cloud share more quickly than its rivals, this could fuel additional growth. There's also Alphabet's renewed focus on artificial intelligence (AI). Earlier this month, at the company's 2023 I/O developer conference, Google announced a laundry list of AI-driven products and features, reminding investors of the company's long history of leveraging the technology to fuel its growth. Data by YCharts How to approach Alphabet stock now Alphabet is currently selling for roughly 27 times trailing earnings and 5 times trailing sales, so the stock isn't the screaming buy it's been over the past year. Still, while value investors might balk at its valuation, I'd suggest that's a reasonable price to pay for a company that's expected to return to double-digit revenue and earnings-per-share growth between now and 2024. As I outlined above, Alphabet has a number of growth drivers that could spark on ongoing stock rally in the months and years to come. Seasoned investors well-suited to withstand a little volatility should consider buying Alphabet or adding to a position now, particularly given the company's strong history of growth and the long runway ahead.

It is an acronym investors use to describe some of the most prominent companies in the tech sector. Originally the acronym was FANG for Facebook, Amazon (AMZN 1.77%),\u00a0Netflix, and Google. The acronym became FAANG in 2017, when investors started including Apple. One FAANG stock that captured many investors' attention lately is Amazon, which looks like it's turning the page from a tough year in 2022 by starting 2023 with a bang. The stock is up 31.26% year to date, beating the S&P 500 index returns of 7.41%. Recently, the company released its first-quarter 2023 earnings report. Investors were initially pleased with the quarterly statement, which exceeded consensus analyst revenue and earnings estimates. However, one thing that disappointed investors was hearing that companies have been cutting back on cloud spending in the current challenging economic climate. Given that cloud computing, its most profitable source of income, is currently struggling, can Amazon's stock crush the market in 2023? Read more to find out why the answer to that question is yes. Investors should focus on the long term Although Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue growth may be affected by current economic concerns, technology experts still expect the cloud industry to experience long-term growth as more companies shift from on-site hosting to cloud-based applications. Amazon's CEO Andy Jassy confirmed that view on the latest earnings call when he said: We've spent a fair bit of time analyzing what we're seeing, and I've spent a good chunk of time myself looking as well, and we like the fundamentals of what we're seeing in AWS. The new customer pipeline looks strong. The set of ongoing migrations of workloads to AWS is strong. The product innovation and delivery is rapid and compelling, and people sometimes forget that 90-plus percent of global IT spend is still on-premises. It's challenging to imagine any company not utilizing the cloud in the future. Once OpenAI released ChatGPT, companies became interested in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and large language models. Most generative AI applications require a large amount of computing power, and the only affordable way for most companies to access such resources is through the cloud. Therefore, as generative AI spreads, it should benefit AWS' long-term revenue and profit growth. Shareholders have more than AWS to be excited about, though. There are other parts of Amazon's business taking off. Amazon Logistics is a competitive advantage In a 2016 letter to shareholders, then CEO Jeff Bezos wrote: \"Customers are always beautifully, wonderfully dissatisfied, even when they report being happy and business is great. Even when they don't yet know it, customers want something better, and your desire to delight customers will drive you to invent on their behalf.\" Early on, Amazon identified one significant customer dissatisfaction in e-commerce: the consumer wanting their item now, not a week from now. So the company built a world-class logistics and fulfillment operation by working to solve this issue. The company built its logistics up so rapidly that competitors could never quite catch up to the delivery speed, convenience, and lower costs of Amazon Prime. As a result, Amazon's delivery service became a competitive advantage. For example, Shopify recently ended its big bet on establishing a logistics operation by divesting Shopify Fulfillment Network, likely because it had a hard time scaling the business to profitability and would also be too costly to attempt to match up to Amazon's logistical capabilities. During Amazon's first-quarter earnings call, Jassy announced that Amazon Logistics had implemented a new structure. The company divided its national fulfillment network in the U.S. into eight interconnected regions, each with its own wide product selection. This change in structure enables shorter travel distances, resulting in lower costs to serve each customer and improved delivery speed to facilitate even more next-day and same-day deliveries. Although it started its logistics operation to enhance its e-commerce operation, Amazon Logistics has already reached a scale to directly compete with UPS and FedEx. Tons of upside here! Advertising is an up-and-coming segment Although growth in the overall advertising industry declined in this economic downturn, Amazon advertising has continued to thrive and outpace the general ad industry and the most prominent online advertisers, Alphabet\u00a0and Meta Platforms. Why are advertisers gravitating to Amazon? It's because Amazon ads target shoppers ready to buy right now, which is not necessarily the case with Google or Meta ads. Today, Amazon's most popular ad formats are sponsored products, sponsored brands, and sponsored displays. But the best days are ahead for its ad segment, as the company is only beginning to actively strategize how to effectively incorporate advertisements into more of its diverse platforms, spanning video, live sports, audio, and grocery stores. You can expect Amazon's advertising business to experience substantial growth in the long term, especially with the anticipated recovery of the advertising industry. Should you buy the stock? Amazon trades for 2.16 times trailing-12-month sales. However, the market valued the stock at a median of 3.02 times trailing-12-month sales over the last 10 years, suggesting the market is undervaluing the stock today. If you're looking for a stock that offers compelling value, has multiple long-term growth drivers, and can survive should the market turn further south, there are few investments better than Amazon.

Learn More A sell-off could make these growth stocks too good to pass up for long-term investors. To quote the great Warren Buffett: \"Be fearful when others are greedy, and greedy when others are fearful.\" I'm sure investors would prefer not to experience down periods, but they can bring good opportunities. Chaos in the madness, if you will. Stock market sell-offs can be a great chance to invest in great companies trading at a value. Here are three growth stocks investors should consider. 1. The Trade Desk The Trade Desk (TTD 2.07%) is an adtech company that specializes in programmatic advertising. Instead of companies bidding for digital ad space, The Trade Desk is the middleman connecting the companies with the digital ad space provider, similar to how a brokerage platform connects stock sellers and buyers. After losing more than half its value in 2022, The Trade Desk has picked up steam, up over 44% year to date (as of May 15). The company increased its Q1 2023 revenue by 21% year over year, which is slower than the growth of its previous four quarters, but still impressive given how the advertising industry has been affected by broader economic conditions. As connected TVs (think smart TVs, Roku, Apple TV+, etc.) and the ad space they provide become more prominent, The Trade Desk has a chance to build a sizable market share. Trading at more than 57x its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, you could make the case that it's a bit overvalued, but if a sell-off happens and the stock price drops, it's a good go-to for investors with time on their side. The company repurchased $293 million worth of its shares in Q1 2023, with $407 million available and authorized for repurchases in the near future. This should signal to investors the company is confident in its long-term execution. 2. Snowflake There was a lot of hype surrounding Snowflake (SNOW 2.94%) after its September IPO, with its stock price increasing over 60% in less than three months. Snowflake is now down over 30% from its IPO price, but all seems to be well under the hood for the data warehousing platform. Snowflake's platform allows users to combine and analyze cloud data from Amazon\u00a0Web Services, Microsoft's Azure, Alphabet's Google Cloud, and other cloud services, and it's been attracting customers at an impressive pace. At the end of its 2023 fiscal year (ending Jan. 31), Snowflake had more than 7,800 customers, up 31% year over year. Of those customers, 330 spend over $1 million annually with the company, and 573 are in the Forbes Global 2000. Snowflake is doing an impressive job at bringing in large companies that can cut bigger checks. Data source: Snowflake. The company's growth has been great, and it's not showing signs of slowing down anytime soon. Although it's not yet profitable, Snowflake's management guided for around 40% year-over-year revenue growth. Snowflake's stock isn't currently undervalued, but if it can maintain its current growth rates for the next few years, it can still provide good returns to investors. 3. Amazon With a market cap topping $1 trillion, Amazon (AMZN 1.77%) may not seem like a traditional growth stock, but considering what's likely to drive the company's growth, I believe it still deserves the title. After a pandemic-fueled run that doubled its value from March 2020 to July 2021, Amazon is since down more than 40%. Amazon has begun drastically cutting costs, slashing around 27,000 corporate jobs and rethinking some of its unprofitable divisions (like devices). Although Amazon is known for its e-commerce, its true moneymaker is Amazon Web Service (AWS) -- its most profitable segment. AWS is the market leader in cloud infrastructure services, and although its growth has slowed compared to recent years because of economic conditions, it's still well positioned to be a cash cow from Amazon going forward as the cloud industry as a whole grows. Another strategic move that could pay off for Amazon is its approach to the AI evolution. Instead of making a direct competitor with chatbots like ChatGPT and Bard, Amazon built Amazon Bedrock, a platform that lets companies build their own AI applications. Amazon Bedrock itself may not be a huge growth driver for the company, but it'll likely be one for AWS, a segment the company knows it needs to prioritize. At current price levels, I believe Amazon can still produce good long-term results, but if a sell-off happens and its price drops, it'll be too good of a deal to pass up on.

Meanwhile, AMD has a lucrative position with its ability to supply chips across the entire tech market. Additionally, Amazon has vast potential with its leading market shares in e-commerce and cloud computing.

Learn More These companies are driving development in three high-growth industries, making them attractive long-term buys. There are some stocks you can buy that are almost guaranteed to grow over the long term thanks to the innovative nature of their businesses. The tech market is an excellent place to find such stocks, as the industry is in a near-constant state of development. As a result, investing in tech companies active in high-growth sectors can be an effective way to ensure you're well off by retirement. In 2023, that means investing in companies pushing markets like virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR), artificial intelligence (AI), and cloud computing forward. These technologies are likely to affect the designs and innovation of countless devices going forward, suggesting their industries are nowhere near hitting their ceilings. Consequently, investing in the companies responsible for their future growth could offer substantial gains over the long term. Here are three top stocks that could help make you rich by retirement. 1. Apple Apple (AAPL 0.84%) shares have long been a haven for investors looking for a reliable long-term buy. The company's stock climbed about 269% in the last five years and over 1,000% in the last decade, offering consistent growth thanks to its priority on delivering quality products. The iPhone maker's strategy has attained immense brand loyalty from consumers, which boosted its ventures into new markets over the years. As a result, Apple's expected launch of a new VR/AR headset has vast potential. According to a report from Bloomberg last month, the device will debut in June and use an iPad-like 3D interface to display a long list of features, such as gaming, fitness, sports, entertainment, reading, and more. Anticipation for the device is steadily growing, with Oculus VR (now owned by Meta) founder Palmer Luckey praising Apple's coming headset and calling it \"so good\" in a recent tweet. The VR/AR market is currently dominated by tech giants Meta and Sony with their respective headsets. However, Apple's history of entering new markets and quickly rising to dominance could see it trounce the competition and lead the $31 billion industry in the coming years. Alongside a history of consistent growth, Apple stock is an excellent option to boost your portfolio in time for retirement. 2. Advanced Micro Devices As a leading chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 2.86%) gives investors a chance to back several high-growth markets. The company's hardware powers platforms and devices across the tech industry, such as game consoles and cloud services. Meanwhile, the tech giant is making moves to grow its position in artificial intelligence. AMD's data center chips have seen it partner with companies like Microsoft and Alphabet, powering their respective cloud platforms. According to Grand View Research, the cloud market hit $484 billion in 2022 and is projected to continue expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 14% through 2030.\u00a0The sector's development is great news for AMD, which could see demand for its chips soar in the coming years. Additionally, a boom in AI is likely to boost the cloud market as more companies use the technology to enhance their platforms. Moreover, Microsoft is reportedly helping AMD bolster its AI chip expansion in an effort to create an alternative to the current market leader, Nvidia. If true, the partnership could help AMD gain a larger share in the booming sector. AMD's stock has soared around 700% since 2018 and more than 2,000% since 2013. Steady growth and the company's ability to supply its chips across multiple areas of tech make its stock a no-brainer buy for those looking for long-term gains. 3. Amazon As a leader in e-commerce and the cloud market, Amazon is another attractive stock that has the potential to skyrocket over the next decade. Amazon holds a leading 38% market share in e-commerce in the U.S., with the second-largest share going to Walmart with 6.3%.\u00a0The company's position at the top of the industry is encouraging, considering the online retail sector is projected to hit $4 trillion this year. Meanwhile, e-commerce sales only made up about 15% of all retail purchases last year, indicating the market still has plenty of room for growth. The e-commerce market and Amazon's related segments were hit hard last year amid an economic downturn. However, easing inflation suggests the challenges won't last forever, with the company's dominance likely to see it flourish in the long term. Along with a leading market share in cloud computing with its platform Amazon Web Services, Amazon's stock is an attractive buy for those looking for a solid investment to hold over the next decade or beyond.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $300 Right Now By Keith Speights \u2013 May 18, 2023 at 5:50AM Key Points Amazon has tremendous growth prospects from its cloud and logistics businesses. Bank of America's valuation is the cheapest it's been in years due to the banking crisis, but the institution remains strong financially. Occidental Petroleum could have several near-term catalysts. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert NYSE: OXY Occidental Petroleum Market Cap $53B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-1.14%)\u00a0-$0.67 Current\u00a0Price $58.25 Price as of May 18, 2023, 10:51 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These Berkshire Hathaway holdings won't cost you a fortune. But they could make you one. You don't have to be a billionaire to invest like Warren Buffett. Actually, you don't need much money at all to follow in the legendary investor's footsteps. Sure, one Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A 0.17%) (BRK.B 0.22%) Class A share costs nearly $500,000. But the top stocks in its equity portfolio aren't nearly as pricey. Here are the three best Buffett stocks to buy with $300 right now. 1. Amazon Berkshire owns more than 10.5 million shares of Amazon (AMZN 1.85%). That's way more than you'll be able to buy. However, with the e-commerce and cloud stock currently trading at less than $115, you can pick up one share of Amazon and have money left over to invest in a couple of other Buffett stocks. Why buy Amazon stock? There are plenty of reasons, but two especially stand out to me. First, the tech company has a massive growth opportunity with its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud hosting business. The rapid advances in artificial intelligence (AI) make AWS even more valuable as organizations scramble to adopt AI. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy thinks that the cloud's market share of information technology spending will increase from between 5% and 10% today to as much as 95% over the next 10 to 15 years. Even if he's overly optimistic (although I don't think he is), AWS stands to be a huge growth driver for the company. Second, Amazon's other crown jewel is its logistics network. Shopify recently announced it's selling most of its logistics business. This move underscores the exceptional moat that Amazon has on this front, in my view. It also puts Amazon in an even stronger position to grow its e-commerce business over the next decade and beyond. 2. Bank of America Buffett seems to have largely shifted away from bank stocks. However,\u00a0Bank of America (BAC -1.10%) is a striking exception. He bought even more shares of the banking giant in the first quarter of 2023. You can buy a couple of shares as well for less than $30 each. Bank of America is trading at the cheapest valuation it has had in years because of the banking crisis. But Buffett understands that the institution remains strong financially. It even posted surprisingly good numbers for the first quarter, with revenue and earnings jumping 13% and 15% year over year, respectively. I suspect that Bank of America's shares will continue to be volatile for a while. The issues for regional banks that have rattled investors won't be resolved overnight, and the mega-bank will be mired in the mess even though it really shouldn't be. Over the longer term, however, I expect this stock will be a big winner. Buffett seems to agree. He wouldn't have added to Berkshire's already huge stake in the bank in recent months if he didn't. 3. Occidental Petroleum There's another stock that Buffett continues to buy at an even more aggressive pace -- Occidental Petroleum (OXY -1.14%). After scooping up a share of Amazon and two of Bank of America, you should have enough money left over from your initial $300 to buy two shares of the oil stock, which is trading at under $60. Many experts predict that oil prices will rise this summer with increased demand and lower production. This should provide a nice catalyst for Occidental stock. It would also boost the company's free cash flow. That's important because CEO Vicki Hollub said in the first-quarter earnings call that the company plans to use excess free cash to buy back shares, which will make the remaining shares outstanding more valuable. Berkshire will also almost certainly continue buying Occidental stock just as it has in recent quarters. The conglomerate has regulatory approval to purchase up to 50% of Occidental. Its stake is currently around 23.6%. Occidental's longer-term prospects are admittedly murkier due to the ongoing shift from fossil fuels to renewable energy sources. However, direct air capture of carbon emissions could present a significant growth opportunity for the company. Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company. John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Keith Speights has positions in Amazon.com, Bank of America, and Berkshire Hathaway. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon.com, Bank of America, Berkshire Hathaway, and Shopify.

Learn More All three of these stocks look like bargains today. It's never too early to start building a portfolio that may eventually make you a millionaire. You can get to work on this no matter what the market is doing because, at any point, the market offers you opportunities. In a bull market, you may pick up some of the safer stocks that investors are ignoring. And in today's difficult market, you can grab great deals on growth stocks. Today, many growth stocks are suffering, but in some cases, prospects over time remain bright. So right now is the perfect time to snap up these players at a bargain price and potentially benefit months or years down the road. Let's talk about three magnificent growth stocks that, as part of a portfolio of solid companies, could help you along the path to wealth 1. Amazon Amazon (AMZN 2.00%) was on an earnings roll, delivering gains in net income year after year -- until last year, when the company swung to a loss for the first time since 2014. That occurred as rising inflation weighed on Amazon's costs and its customers' buying power. At the same time, the retail giant found itself with excess capacity after expanding its fulfillment network. That may sound grim, but there are two huge positive points here. First, today's tough economic environment is temporary. Second, the situation has pushed Amazon to improve its cost structure and make moves that should benefit earnings now and over the long term. For example, Amazon is switching its U.S. fulfillment network from a national model to a regional one -- a move that should speed up deliveries and reduce costs. Other cost-cutting efforts are starting to bear fruit, as well. In Amazon's most recent earnings report, operating cash flow increased in the double-digits. And free cash flow improved to an outflow of $3.3 billion from more than five times that amount a year ago. Amazon remains a leader in two high-growth markets -- e-commerce and cloud computing -- and should benefit from this down the road. Meanwhile, today you can pick up the shares for nearly their lowest in relation to sales since 2016. 2. Moderna Moderna (MRNA -0.93%) isn't exactly in the doldrums today because of the economic environment. Instead, the drop in coronavirus vaccine sales is hurting the stock. The vaccine is Moderna's only product right now. But here's why you shouldn't flee Moderna and pick up the shares, instead. The company has set out a path that may lead to huge market share in the respiratory vaccines market. The market size for coronavirus, flu, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) vaccines should total about $30 billion by 2027. And Moderna aims to take as much as half of that by that time. The company also forecasts $4 billion to $9 billion in annual free cash flow from respiratory vaccines, if all goes well. And that level could move higher. The biotech company already has set out to reach its goals. It aims to launch flu and RSV vaccines next year. And it continues to work on updated coronavirus vaccines, including a candidate that offers protection against more than one respiratory virus. All of this sounds great, but Moderna's growth potential doesn't stop here. That's because the company has more than 40 programs in development across therapeutic areas. If even a handful make it to commercialization, this could further add to earnings growth. Moderna trades for less than 9 times forward earnings estimates -- and that looks like a steal, considering the potential products on the horizon. 3. Chewy Chewy (CHWY -0.85%), an online seller of pet supplies, announced record revenue, profit, and free cash flow in its full-year 2022 earnings report. In spite of today's difficult environment, pet owners still are spending on their furry (and sometimes not-so-furry) friends. But Chewy doesn't sell just pet supplies. The company also offers online vet visits, as well as pet insurance. Shoppers can turn to Chewy for pretty much all of their pet needs. And considering the total U.S. pet market is worth about $130 billion, there's still plenty of room for the company to grow. Chewy has an excellent track record. It's more than tripled revenue over the past four years to surpass $10 billion. And over that time period, it's expanded its gross margin to 28% from 20%. Finally, it's widened adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) margins to 3% from negative 6.5%. Today, Chewy is taking steps to boost earnings even more over time. The company is transforming its supply chain to favor automation. It's already opened three automated fulfillment centers and is getting ready to open a fourth. Chewy's share price doesn't reflect the company's growth. The stock has dropped 9% this year, after falling nearly 40% last year. Right now, the stock trades at 67 times forward earnings estimates, down from 120 just a few months ago. The company still is in the early stages of its growth story -- so there's plenty of room for earnings and share-price gains down the road. And that makes it a great addition to your \"make me a millionaire\" portfolio. John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Adria Cimino has positions in Amazon.com. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Amazon.com and Chewy. The Motley Fool recommends Moderna. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

A 13F provides a neat-and-tidy snapshot that investors can use to determine what stocks the brightest minds on Wall Street have been buying and selling. Monday, May 15, marked the deadline for asset managers to file their 13Fs for the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images. Amid this vast sea of 13Fs, the filing from billionaire money manager Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies stands out. Simons is an active fund manager with $106 billion in assets under management and stakes in thousands of companies. But it's what he and his team were busy buying and selling during the first quarter that should catch investors' attention. In spite of the FAANG stocks leading the broader market higher in 2023, billionaire Jim Simons has been an active seller in all but one component. Billionaire Jim Simons couldn't hit the sell button fast enough with three FAANG stocks When I say FAANG stocks, I'm talking about: Facebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms (META 0.40%) Apple (AAPL 0.84%) Amazon (AMZN 1.94%) Netflix (NFLX 7.97%) Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL 0.94%) (GOOG 0.97%) The FAANGs are undisputed market share leaders within their respective industries, and they have an extensive history of outperforming the benchmark S&P 500 over long periods. It's why everyday and professional investors typically flock to the FAANGs. But this hasn't been the case with Simons' Renaissance Technologies. During the first quarter, Renaissance completely exited its position in Alphabet by selling more than 4.21 million Class A shares (GOOGL) and around 588,000 Class C shares (GOOG). Additionally, Simons' fund sold 7.09 million shares of Apple (nearly its entire stake), and close to 2.35 million shares of Amazon. AAPL PE Ratio data by YCharts. Why sell stakes in these amazing businesses? One of the likeliest reasons has to do with the expanding valuations of these three FAANG stocks. On a trailing-12-month basis, Amazon, Apple, and Alphabet were commanding price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 263, 29, and 25, respectively, as of this past weekend. That's up considerably from where all three began the year. During a bear market, investors tend to pay more attention to valuation. To add to this point, tech stocks are as pricey as they've ever been, relative to the S&P 500. Though tech stocks like Apple and Alphabet have led the way over the trailing decade, higher interest rates, coupled with high tech stock P/E ratios, suggest this outperformance may come to an end. Lastly, the Federal Reserve is now modeling a mild recession into its outlook for later this year. Alphabet, Amazon, and Apple are all cyclical stocks at risk of seeing their sales slump if a recession materializes. Alphabet generates the bulk of its revenue from advertising; Amazon's biggest revenue generator is its e-commerce platform; and despite a big surge in services revenue, Apple still logs the majority of its sales from physical products, such as the iPhone. Some combination of the above factors likely encouraged Jim Simons and his team to be aggressive sellers of these three FAANG stocks in the first quarter. Image source: Getty Images. The one FAANG stock Simons bought hand over fist in the first quarter However, you'll note there are two other FAANGs I've yet to discuss: social media stock Meta Platforms and streaming services behemoth Netflix. During the first quarter, Renaissance modestly reduced its Meta stake by close to 78,700 shares, and it absolutely piled into Netflix by purchasing more than 624,000 shares. The reasons Renaissance chose to buy shares of Netflix while selling stakes in the other four FAANGs probably has to do with some combination of profitability, cash flow, and innovation. Netflix is dealing with plenty of competition in the streaming space from the likes of Walt Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount Global. However, these legacy media companies all share one thing in common: steep losses associated with their streaming segments. After focusing on subscriber growth, Disney, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Paramount all need to turn their attention to streaming profitability. Meanwhile, Netflix has been profitable on a recurring basis for more than a decade. Netflix has also shown improvements in its cash flow. Following years of cash outflows tied to its international expansion, Netflix logged more than $2.1 billion in free cash flow (FCF) in the first quarter and upped its full-year forecast to at least $3.5 billion in FCF. There's also Netflix's innovation, which ranges from its mile-long list of original series to its recently launched ad-supported tier that comes with a lower monthly price. The company's willingness to adjust its operating model to fit the demands of consumers is helping to push earnings forecasts higher. However, I'd be remiss if I didn't also point out that Netflix is, arguably, the priciest FAANG stock relative to its cash flow. Whereas Alphabet and Amazon are valued at well below their historic cash-flow multiples for 2023 and 2024, investors are respectively paying 35 and 25 times forecast cash flow for shares of Netflix in 2023 and 2024. It may be an industry leader, but it's far from cheap. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

AWS said it has hundreds of thousands of customers in India, including government entities such as the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, large companies including Axis Bank and HDFC Life, and others in public, private and nonprofit sectors. AWS is the largest cloud-computing provider in the U.S., providing services that allow customers, including many large businesses, to rent computing, storage and network capabilities. The company has been expanding its overseas footprint, including other regions of Asia. In October, it unveiled plans to invest more than $5 billion in Thailand over 15 years, and in March it said it would invest $6 billion in nearby Malaysia over roughly the same span.

Tech Companies To Watch In The Remote Work Eraby David Daxsen, Benzinga Contributor May 17, 2023 1:34 PM |  4 min read With the rise of remote work due to the COVID-19 pandemic, technology companies have become more important than ever. As a result, the stock prices of tech giants such as Microsoft MSFT, Apple\u00a0AAPL and Amazon\u00a0AMZN have surged, and investors are eagerly watching for any signs of continued growth.Jason Lee, founder and CEO of OptionsSwing believes smart investing in this opportunistic economic era is going to center on forward-looking technology companies that have their hand on the pulse of the post-pandemic work world.Looking for which tech companies are likely to provide the most impressive returns in the coming fiscal year? Lee suggests keeping an eye on cloud-based corporations as a leading point, companies like DigitalOcean DOCN, which has positioned its cloud infrastructure services to be specifically applicable to the needs of smaller companies. \u201cMost big companies made the migration to the cloud some time ago, so look for technology entities that are built to serve smaller businesses,\u201d Lee advises. \u201cCovid showed companies that employees don\u2019t have to be in office to be productive and that, in fact, productivity measurably increases with remote work so everyone who owns a business is going to be looking for new and more expansive ways to promote that. Look for the tech companies that are building what those companies need to scale by leveraging remote work.\u201dLee\u2019s own career trajectory tells much about what is likely to have worth in the tech space of today\u2019s market. He built both of his companies using technology that arose out of a demonstrated need in his day-to-day life. \u201cI realized that I was building a significant business with OptionsSwing, but the entire technology that is running it and allowing us to grow like that could be used for tens of thousands of other businesses that are also using similar platforms,\u201d he reflects.Lee believes a conservative stance toward newer tech assets is always prudent. Giving companies time to grow and show their worth before putting too many eggs in that basket also gives investors time to dig further into their potential. \u201cEssentially, successful tech investment right now is about engaging with tomorrow\u2019s tools,\u201d he says, \u201cand to do that effectively investors to do their homework on how businesses are growing and what they might need in the future to keep up with the evolving remote space.\u201dA few examples of tech-based areas to explore include companies that specialize in observability software, user experience monitoring, developer testing, cybersecurity and artificial intelligence. On the material side of the equation, \u201cDon\u2019t forget the companies that actually make the hardware,\u201d Lee reminds. For solid, long-term investments, which Lee always advises for first-time investors, go with companies that have a proven history to stand on. Companies like Amazon and Microsoft are not likely to go bust or become irrelevant in the tech sphere anytime soon. Likewise, in the cell phone space, as we move forward in capability with handheld devices, companies like Samsung SSNLF and Apple can be relied upon to continue to lead the fields of innovation and thus represent solid short and long-term investments.By the same token, Lee\u2019s own brainchild, Ternary Developments, embodies the aspect of tech that may well boom biggest in the global transition to remote work: streamlining.\u201cBusinesses don\u2019t want to work with five different vendors in order to run their business,\u201d he says. \u201cThey would rather work with one vendor who has a single platform with all the tools they need, including a single customer database.\u201d It is likely that investing in companies that smooth out data translation B2B or B2C while offering those end-to-end platform tools will continue to be a responsible move.\u201cThe best thing any hesitant investor can do is get into a quality conversation with other investors through a dedicated community,\u201d Lee concludes. \u201cThere is so much opportunity for everyone and these investment communities are great for offering real insights and support to all types of traders.\u201dThis article is from an external contributor.

Bull, Bear Case For The Stockby Melanie Schaffer, Benzinga Editor May 17, 2023 11:21 AM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsAmazon is trading in an uptrend, making a consistent series of higher highs and higher lows.The stock has one of the strongest trends of the mega-cap names.Amazon.com, Inc AMZN was trading higher Wednesday, continuing in a strong uptrend after printing a higher low on Monday.The e-commerce and streaming giant has been trading in the pattern since March 13 and has one of the strongest uptrends of all the mega-cap names. An uptrend occurs when a stock consistently makes a series of higher highs and higher lows on the chart.The higher highs indicate the bulls are in control, while the intermittent higher lows indicate consolidation periods.Traders can use moving averages to help identify an uptrend, with rising lower time frame moving averages (such as the eight-day or 21-day exponential moving averages) indicating the stock is in a steep shorter-term uptrend.Rising longer-term moving averages (such as the 200-day simple moving average) indicate a long-term uptrend.Want direct analysis? Find me in the BZ Pro lounge! Click here for a free trial.The Amazon Chart: Amazon crossed above the 200-day simple moving averge (SMA) on May 10 and has been riding up the eight-day exponential moving average (EMA) since May 5. The 50-day SMA, which is curling upward, will eventually cross above the 200-day SMA to form a golden cross if Amazon continues to trend higher. Amazon\u2019s most recent higher low was printed at the $109.25 mark on Monday and the most recent confirmed higher high was formed on May 11 at $113.28. Technical traders may have predicted Amazon would move higher on Tuesday and Wednesday because on Monday, the stock formed a doji candlestick, indicating an upward reversal\u00a0was likely. Traders can watch for Amazon to print its next higher high over the coming days because the stock\u2019s relative strength index is measuring in at about 67%. If Amazon rises on Wednesday, the RSI may move over 70%, which would indicate the stock has entered overbought territory and a pullback is likely. Amazon has resistance above at $117.16 and $125.93 and support below at $109.30 and $99.88.

Learn More Alphabet is well positioned to benefit from the growing demand for AI software. Billionaire investor Bill Ackman recently bought stock in Alphabet (GOOG 0.96%) (GOOGL 0.92%) for his hedge fund Pershing Square Capital Management. He started the position during the first quarter, but news of the purchase only surfaced this week, days after Alphabet introduced new artificial intelligence (AI) products at its I/O developer conference. Of course, those products had nothing to do with Ackman's decision, but as one of the foremost AI companies in the world, Alphabet is well positioned to benefit from soaring demand for AI software. That likely contributed to the decision, and Ackman seems to have a great deal of confidence in the company. His investment in Alphabet is worth more than $1 billion, split between Class A and Class C shares, and it accounts for over 10% of his portfolio. So what? Pershing Square absolutely crushed the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.42%) during the last five years. The hedge fund soared 239% in that time, but the benchmark S&P 500 index increased just 70%. That makes Ackman a great source of inspiration, and given the latest addition to his portfolio, investors should take a closer look at Alphabet. Alphabet has a strong presence in two growing markets Alphabet has undoubtedly struggled over the past year. Revenue rose just 5% to $284 billion, a significant deceleration from 47% growth a year earlier, and net income declined 19% to $4.49 per diluted share. But those lackluster results can be attributed to the challenging economic climate. High inflation and rising interest rates have suppressed consumer spending, forcing businesses to cut ad budgets and curb IT investments. That has naturally been bad news for Alphabet, a company that makes most of its money from digital advertising and cloud computing services. But bad news often creates buying opportunities for patient investors. Alphabet stock is down 20%, and shares currently trade at 5.5 times sales, a discount to the five-year average of 6.3 times sales. That price looks reasonable given its strong competitive position in ad tech and cloud computing, two\u00a0markets forecasted to grow at 14% annually through 2030. Alphabet is the largest ad tech company on the planet. It raked in nearly 30% of global digital ad spend last year, and while the company is losing market share to up-and-comers like Amazon, Alphabet will still account for 29% of global digital ad spend in 2024, according to eMarketer. That success can be traced back to its lineup of popular web properties. Google Search, YouTube, and Chrome are the most popular search engine, streaming service, and web browser, respectively. Those assets make Alphabet an irreplaceable advertising partner. Meanwhile, Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is gaining ground in cloud computing. The company held 10%\u00a0market share in cloud infrastructure and platforms services (CIPS) in the first quarter, up from 8% last year, indicating that its revamped go-to-market strategy and continuous product development efforts are paying off. Indeed, consultancy Gartner recently noted that GCP is improving its CIPS capabilities faster than any other cloud provider. That means the company is well positioned to maintain its momentum in the future. Alphabet is investing in artificial intelligence (AI) OpenAI has ignited tremendous interest in AI with its viral application ChatGPT, but the market is still early in its adoption of the technology. According to Ark Invest, AI software revenue will grow at 42% annually to reach 14 trillion by 2030. That means there is plenty of room for multiple winners, and Alphabet is well positioned to be one of those winners. Google has used AI to improve search relevance and ad performance for over a decade, and the company is clearly doing something right given its leadership in both markets. But that is just the tip of the iceberg. Industry experts have also recognized Alphabet a leader in other AI verticals, including AI infrastructure, conversational AI platforms, and AI-powered document analytics. And the company recently unveiled several exciting products at its I/O developer conference. One of the most exciting updates is its new large language model PaLM 2, which brings generative AI capabilities to more than 25 other products. For instance, PaLM 2 helps users compose content in Gmail and Google Docs, organize data in Google Sheets, and generate AI images from text descriptions in Google Slides. PaLM 2 also powers Bard, an intelligent chatbot meant to rival ChatGPT. Bard can handle a wide range of questions, from common sense logic to complex math, and it can now help developers write code. Here's the bottom line: Alphabet is investing aggressively in AI, building on years research and development. Those efforts could reinforce its dominance in digital advertising, help it gain share in cloud computing, and open brand new revenue streams for the company. With shares trading at a discount to their historical valuation, investors should consider buying a position in this growth stock today.

He\u2019s not the only one. MarketWatch photo illustration/iStockphoto Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement JD -3.66% BABA -4.23% PDD -5.43% NIO -2.37% NTES -0.36% BIDU -3.71% COST +0.62% KWEB -3.39% AMZN +2.10% Corrects value in paragraph 12 to \u201ca couple of hundred billion dollars\u201d. Quarterly U.S. regulatory filings this week revealed that Scion Asset Management, the hedge fund founded by Michael Burry, doubled down on China stock bets. The question is, should investors? Burry\u2019s investment moves are widely followed as he correctly called the collapse of the U.S. housing market that triggered the 2008 financial crisis. He shot to fame after appearing in Michael Lewis\u2019s book \u201cThe Big Short,\u201d that was later a movie.  The filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, known as a 13F, revealed Scion had 10% of his U.S.-listed portfolio in China retailing giant JD.com JD, -3.66% and 9.6% in e-commerce giant Alibaba BABA, -4.23% at the end of the first quarter. Scion was also a buyer of those names in the fourth quarter of 2022, but as the holdings information is backward looking, it\u2019s unclear if the fund remains invested. Burry hasn\u2019t responded to a request for comment from MarketWatch. Scion wasn\u2019t alone in that China enthusiasm, though. Hedge fund Third Point also took a new position in Alibaba, and hedge fund Hillhouse Capital\u00a0Advisors, filing under HHLR Advisors, added to its position in Alibaba, PDD Holdings and other China names.  Investors have been riding out a not-so-easy year for China stocks. U.S.-listed shares of JD.com are down 33% year to date, while Alibaba, which reported mixed results on Thursday, is up around 3%, after dropping more than 20% in 2022.  Online retailer  PDD PDD, -5.43% is off 18%, with EV maker NIO NIO, -2.37% down 17%, while online internet tech group NetEase NTES, -0.36% is up 21%. Reporting Tuesday, Chinese search engine operator Baidu BIDU, -3.71% got a boost after beating forecasts and swinging to a first-quarter profit. Some of the wobbles for China stocks are down to uncertainty over how long the country will take to emerge fully from its zero-COVID policy. Data out Tuesday showed disappointing growth in China retail sales and industrial production, and a youth unemployment rate at a record 20.4%. Read: China\u2019s reopening recovery is running out of steam and starting to worry financial markets Among those not ready to give up on China is Thomas Hayes, chairman of hedge fund Great Hill Capital. He has owned Alibaba for over a year and says right now is an \u201copportunity to buy and an opportunity to hold. I think we\u2019re in the final stages of the shakeout that\u2019s been going on for the last year.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s not a business globally of its scale,\u201d Hayes says of Alibaba in a telephone interview with MarketWatch. And that\u2019s as shares are also trading at deep discount to intrinsic value \u2014 if the business had to be liquidated. He sees big benefits from IPOs Alibaba\u2019s management is planning for many different units. For instance, Alibaba could deliver China\u2019s next Costco COST, +0.62%, with its Freshippo grocery business, where an IPO worth $10 billion is being planned, says Hayes. Then there\u2019s the global e-commerce business Lazada and AliExpress, with plans for an IPO of $39 billion, and all that all before touching on potential for Alibaba\u2019s cloud unit, which Hayes is most excited about. He refers to a report by global management consultant McKinsey that has predicted the China cloud business will triple by 2025. Alibaba said Thursday that its board has approved a full spinoff of the Cloud Intelligence Unit.  Adding all this up, Hayes said \u201cyou\u2019ve got a business that would be hard to replicate for less than $1 trillion. And it\u2019s trading at a couple of hundred billion dollars in the markets right now.\u201d For now, the problem is some despondency toward Chinese stocks, that\u2019s partially justified due to \u201cmercurial government leadership behavior,\u201d which is changing.  The government now wants to drive domestic spending and Alibaba is well placed for that, said Hayes, who thinks that in two to three years, the stock could double. He owns both the ADR and Hong Kong-listed shares.  KraneShares, an exchange-traded fund provider that focuses on Chinese listed companies, holds Alibaba, Baidu and other big-name Chinese stocks in the KraneShares CSI China Internet ETF KWEB, -3.39%. The fund is \u201chighly geared to domestic consumption in the country,\u201d KraneShares chief investment officer Brendan Ahern, told MarketWatch. (KraneShares is majority owned by China International Capital Corporation.)\u2018Not like flicking a switch\u2019 \u201cBroadly speaking what\u2019s happening, China in this post-zero COVID world is having this incremental economic recovery. It\u2019s not like flicking a switch where all of a sudden everyone is back at it. Your consumer confidence has to grow, you know, people have to see the economy is improving, and our thesis has been that Q1 will be better than Q4, Q2 will be better than Q1,\u201d Ahern told MarketWatch.  From excitement around the reopening last year, China faded from the spotlight for investors, partly owing to a U.S. banking crisis. In a note to clients earlier in May, JPMorgan acknowledged that the country\u2019s COVID consumption recovery has thus far lagged behind that of other major economies.  \u201cThis has led to more subdued growth expectations regarding earnings and reduced positioning in cyclical bets in favor of thematic bets,\u201d wrote the bank\u2019s China equity strategist Wendy Liu. But like others, she appealed for patience, noting that China consumer confidence tends to lag business confidence by about six months. \u201cGiven that business confidence first improved in November 2022, assuming a 9-10-month lag,\u00a0late 3Q/4Q 2023\u00a0is when we may see better data, all else being equal,\u201d said Liu.  Creating more buzz around investing in China was a recent Economist magazine cover, which discussed slowing growth, though based on the magazine-cover theory, could be seen by some as a contrarian indicator. Hedge-fund manager Hayes is also sanguine about China\u2019s progress.  \u201cYou\u2019ve got to give the patient a little time to heal. What happened in China over the last three years was completely devastating,\u201d he said.  As for Alibaba, he has a pretty good idea of the path forward for the company he views as an early Amazon.com AMZN, +2.10%. He says Alibaba\u2019s cloud business is at the spot that Amazon Web Services was in 2016 in terms of revenues and low margins.  \u201cI can assure you when this stock is over $200, everyone, all the pessimists who said it was not investible at $80 are going to be saying, \u2018This is the future, a billion people [in China], the cloud is just getting started,'\u201d said Hayes.

He compares concerns about AI today to concerns people had about other new technologies years ago.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More AI offers investment opportunities across industries. Companies across industries are using artificial Intelligence (AI). And that has people thinking about what AI means for the future of many professions. Alphabet (GOOG 0.85%) (GOOGL 0.79%), the parent company of Google, is no stranger to AI. The company uses AI throughout its business -- from optimizing its search capabilities to better serving its advertising customers. Recently, Alphabet chief executive officer Sundar Pichai spoke about how AI is set to revolutionize the working world. He even said one industry in particular might be transformed by the technology. And, surprisingly, Pichai says this may not result in layoffs -- but instead, more jobs. Pichai's AI prediction Pichai told The Verge in an interview that AI may make the law profession better in certain ways and may result in more people actually becoming lawyers. Law firms today already use AI to help draft documents, verify contracts, and complete other tasks. The idea is AI won't take away lawyers' jobs. Instead, it will help them and their staff do certain things more quickly -- and give them more time to focus on more complicated parts of the job. \"I'm willing to almost bet 10 years from now, maybe there are more lawyers,\" Pichai said in the interview. Pichai said that some of the jitters people have about AI today are a lot like the worries they had years ago with the introduction of new technology like computers or the Internet. Yes, these technologies may have hurt some jobs, but they've also introduced many new ones and resulted in overall progression in the employment market. Pichai is doing his part to advance the use of AI. He's made it a focus at Alphabet. For instance, the company uses it to help the Google search engine better understand the meaning of each vocal and written search. Another example, this time in the area of advertising: An AI tool predicts how much advertisers should spend to meet their campaign goals. So, the use of AI isn't necessarily about eliminating jobs. It's about improving how we do them. And this makes AI a great new technology to invest in today. Alphabet itself is a solid AI stock to buy -- and investors will like the company for other reasons too, such as its giant market share in the search market. Google Search holds 92% of that market. And its use of AI may keep that going. Investing in AI You also can invest in AI by buying shares of e-commerce giant Amazon (AMZN 1.77%). The company has used AI for years -- that's what helps Amazon recommend products to you that you may like, for example. And last year, Amazon\u00a0even bought a company called Snackable.AI. Amazon intends to use the company's machine learning tools to boost its streaming and podcast capabilities. But AI isn't limited to tech companies. You'll find companies in healthcare turning their attention to the area too. Vaccine maker Moderna (MRNA -1.01%) used AI to help it in the development of the coronavirus vaccine -- and is using it to make research and development more efficient. Moderna even recently signed a deal with International Business Machines to use that company's AI platform in the drug development process. And Medtronic is using AI in many ways, such as predicting outcomes in spine surgery. That means there are plenty of stocks today offering you opportunities for AI investing. So, this technology may transform jobs -- as Pichai says -- and it may also open the door to new investment possibilities.

Amazon is a leader in e-commerce and cloud computing, and it\u2019s gaining market share in digital advertising. PayPal is the leader in online payment processing, and it\u2019s working to gain share in physical retail.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These growth stocks could help investors capitalize on the inevitable rebound of the S&P 500 index. The S&P 500 goes up more often than it goes down. Since its inception in 1957, the index has declined in 18 calendar years, but it has increased in 47 calendar years. It was also flat once. Another noteworthy statistic is that the S&P 500 tends to rebound following a down year. Since 1957, the index has produced a median return of 20% in the year immediately following a decline. That information hints at possibly big gains in the not-too-distant future. The S&P 500 dropped 19.4% in 2022, and it has rebounded 7.4% in 2023. But if this year falls in line with the median, the index will rise another 12.6% before the end of 2023. Of course, past events never guarantee future results, but investors should view the current environment as a buying opportunity regardless of whether the stock market rises or falls in the near term. Here are two growth stocks to buy now and hold forever. Amazon: E-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing Amazon (AMZN 1.85%) reported weak results last year when faced with economic headwinds, but those challenges are temporary and the company has already regained some momentum. Revenue increased 9% to $127 billion in the first quarter, and Amazon reported $4.8 billion in cash from operations, up from a loss of $2.8 billion the year before. Better yet, given Amazon's strong position in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, sales growth and profitability should continue to improve as economic conditions improve. The Amazon marketplace draws more monthly visitors than any other digital shopping destination. It accounted for 38% of online retail sales in North America and Western Europe last year. That success underpins a powerful network effect, meaning each buyer makes the marketplace more valuable to every seller, and vice versa. But Amazon has reinforced that flywheel by offering merchants adjacent solutions for logistics and digital advertising, both of which make its marketplace even more compelling. Online retail sales are expected to increase 13.6% annually through 2030, and few companies are better positioned to benefit from that trend. Amazon offers ad tech solutions that enable brands to run data-driven campaigns on and off the marketplace, and that segment of its business has been growing like wildfire. Amazon has quietly become the fourth-largest ad tech company in the world, and it's taking share from industry leader Alphabet. That portends strong growth in the future, as Grand View Research estimates the ad tech market will grow at a 13.7% annualized rate through 2030. Finally, Amazon Web Services (AWS) dominates the market for cloud infrastructure and platform services (CIPS). It accounted for 32% of CIPS spending in the fourth quarter, putting it nine percentage points ahead of runner-up Microsoft. Moreover, consultancy Gartner says AWS offers the \"greatest breadth and depth of capabilities of any provider in the market for CIPS.\" That hints at a greater capacity for innovation, which should keep Amazon at the forefront of cloud computing technology. Grand View Research estimates the cloud computing market will increase at 14.1%\u00a0annually through 2030. Currently, shares trade at 2.2 times sales, a bargain compared to the five-year average of 3.6 times sales, and a very reasonable price for a company with a good shot at double-digit revenue growth through the end of the decade. PayPal: Digital payments PayPal Holdings (PYPL -0.23%) reported solid financial results in the first quarter, a pleasant change of pace after a challenging 2022. Revenue increased 9% to $7 billion, and non-GAAP earnings rose 33% to $1.17 per diluted share. Both of those metrics represent sequential and year-over-year accelerations, and the particularly strong growth on the bottom line indicates that cost-cutting efforts are taking effect. Specifically, management has refocused its investment strategy on areas where the company enjoys a strong competitive edge: checkout solutions and digital wallets. Indeed, the investment thesis centers around those products. PayPal operates one of the largest payment networks in the world, with 433 million active accounts. Few companies ever achieve adoption on that scale, and PayPal owes much of its success to its two-sided payments network. Most payment processors work only with merchants, but PayPal provides financial services to merchants and consumers, and that gives it an edge. Specifically, PayPal has more insight into consumer spending habits compared to many peers. It uses that data to drive sales and prevent fraud for its merchants, and it does those things quite well. In fact, CEO Dan Schulman says PayPal has the lowest loss rates and the highest approval rate in the industry. In turn, PayPal has become the most accepted digital wallet in North America and Europe, and the market leader in online payment processing software, according to Statista. Here's the bottom line: PayPal is well-positioned to benefit as digital payments become more prevalent. But the company isn't simply resting on its laurels. PayPal has continued to develop new products in an effort to reinforce its strong market presence. It recently launched PayPal Complete Payments (PPCP), an unbranded checkout solution that complements its Braintree platform. Braintree is designed for large enterprises, but PPCP is built for small businesses, and management believes the product extends its addressable market by $750 billion. PayPal stock currently trades at 2.5 times sales, its cheapest valuation in more than five years. That creates a very attractive buying opportunity for patient investors.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Amazon Just Made a Big Move Nobody Is Talking About By Danny Vena \u2013 May 17, 2023 at 8:50AM Key Points Amazon has completely reorganized its distribution and fulfilment network. Rather than one nationwide network, the company has created eight interconnected regional areas. This could result in quicker shipments while also lowering shipping costs -- bolstering Amazon's bottom line. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMZN Amazon.com Market Cap $1,185B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.91%)\u00a0$2.21 Current\u00a0Price $117.70 Price as of May 18, 2023, 10:47 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More An ambitious undertaking could benefit both customers and shareholders. The past year or so has been a tough time to be an Amazon (AMZN 1.91%) shareholder. After the stock peaked at the height of the pandemic, tough economic conditions have weighed on it, as consumer spending was hampered by high inflation and rising interest rates. This has resulted in tepid growth, as Amazon's first-quarter net sales of $127 billion grew 9% year over year, a far cry from the double-digit gains in 2021. In the face of slowing growth and a bid to increase profitability, the e-commerce leader has quietly -- and without much fanfare -- made a change behind the scenes that could potentially speed up its deliveries, while also bolstering the bottom line. Image source: Getty Images. Tucked away in the shareholder letter Under the purview of former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, the company's annual shareholder letter became something of a must read, as it gave investors important insight into the company's strategy and a peak behind the curtain at one of the world's most successful technology companies. Current CEO Andy Jassy has put his own unique spin on the document, which contained this gem about critical changes to the company's fulfillment network: We made significant internal changes (e.g. placement and logistics software, processes, physical operations) to create eight interconnected regions in smaller geographic areas. Each of these regions has broad, relevant selection to operate in a largely self-sufficient way, while still being able to ship nationally when necessary. Jassy went on to point out that the company continues to tweak its machine-learning algorithms, which will help it better predict inventory needs at Amazon's various geographic locations. A little change that could lead to big savings While these changes might not seem like a big deal, it's important to put the move in context. Delivery is among Amazon's biggest expenses, costing nearly $20 billion in the first quarter alone, or nearly 16% of the company's total revenue. According to Jassy, the early results are encouraging, noting that shorter travel distances \"mean lower cost.\" Another benefit of this change is that since items are closer to their ultimate destinations, they'll likely arrive more quickly, with \"customers getting their orders faster.\" To that end, Amazon is increasing the number of products eligible for next-day and same-day deliveries. Jassy went on to note that Amazon is \"on track to have our fastest Prime delivery speeds ever in 2023.\" A true win-win? Amazon began this ambitious undertaking last year in a bid to lower shipping costs while simultaneously speeding up delivery times. For years, Amazon has operated its fulfillment network as a national distribution center, with fulfillment hubs spread across the U.S. As the company grew, the number of shipments skyrocketed, and getting the products to customers at times became a logistical nightmare. Rapid expansion of the fulfillment network during the pandemic only exacerbated the situation, as Amazon nearly doubled its fulfillment-center footprint in just two years. This, in turn, increased the complexity across the entire system. If this initiative is successful, it will mark a rare win for both customers and investors. Lower shipping costs will increase profits, which will benefit the company and shareholders alike, while faster shipments will be a boon to customers. It's too early to tell whether Amazon will ultimately achieve this two-pronged goal of speeding up delivery times while decreasing costs, but it certainly bears watching.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research A Bull Market Is Coming: 2 Good Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Right Now By Joe Tenebruso \u2013 May 17, 2023 at 7:45AM Key Points Don\u2019t let short-term concerns cause you to miss out on Amazon's tantalizing long-term prospects. Artificial intelligence and retail store closures could propel Amazon's shares to new heights. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMZN Amazon.com Market Cap $1,185B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.94%)\u00a0$2.24 Current\u00a0Price $117.74 Price as of May 18, 2023, 10:50 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More This growth stock's recent rally might be just getting started. Amazon's (AMZN 1.94%) stock price is quietly up more than 30% so far in 2023, and more gains appear likely. Here's why the cloud and e-commerce juggernaut's recent bull run is set to continue -- and perhaps even intensify. 1. AI is set to reaccelerate cloud growth In late April, Chief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said that Amazon Web Services' (AWS) revenue growth had slowed to roughly 11% from 16% in the first quarter. The news drove some investors to sell, though Amazon's stock has since recovered its losses. Investors are likely beginning to realize that much of the slowdown in AWS' growth rate is due to recession fears, which are driving many businesses to temporarily temper their technology investments. Yet even if we do fall into a recession, the economy will eventually strengthen, and this intense pressure to cut costs will ease. In the meantime, Amazon is actively working to help its cloud clients reduce their expenses. Management correctly believes that this will strengthen customer loyalty and further cement Amazon's place atop the cloud industry. Moreover, Morgan Stanley analyst Meta Marshall posits that the industry's efforts to optimize customers' spending will help to expand the overall size of the cloud market by as much as 30% over the long term. In all, Marshall estimates the total cloud-computing opportunity at a staggering $18 trillion. Some investors think that Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) will capture a larger share of this massive pie thanks to its multi-billion-dollar investment in ChatGPT maker OpenAI. But although Big Softy might be off to an early lead in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, Amazon has a well-crafted plan to catch up, fast. Rather than trying to lock users into a few AI models, like those offered by OpenAI, Amazon wants to make a large variety available to its cloud clients. \"We believe that customers are going to need a lot of different generative AI models for different purposes, and it is unlikely that any one model is going to serve all customers or even all the needs of one customer,\" AWS CEO Adam Selipsky said during a recent interview with The Wall Street Journal. AWS, in turn, is offering access to technology provided by AI upstarts such as Hugging Face, Stability AI, and Anthropic, as well as its own recently launched Titan suite of models. For all these reasons, Amazon's leading cloud market share seems well-secured -- and its cloud growth rates appear set to reaccelerate in the coming years. 2. Don't underestimate e-commerce After writing off Amazon's sprawling e-commerce empire as simply a loss-making crusade, many investors are starting to wise up to its true profit potential. It's true that brick-and-mortar retailers have enjoyed a revival over the past couple of years, which has weighed on Amazon's results. People, eager to leave their homes once COVID-related restrictions were eased, returned to their historical shopping destinations. But this resurgence is likely to prove temporary. Retailers are beginning to shutter stores once again, including announcements for more than 2,000 closings in the U.S. alone so far in 2023. UBS analyst Michael Lasser believes that this number could climb to over 50,000 stores by the end of 2027. Lasser sees the percentage of people who shop online rising from 20% to 26% by that time. Many smaller retailers can't afford to invest in their e-commerce operations, according to Lasser. This will be even more true if we enter a prolonged recession. Amazon, meanwhile, stands to benefit from these trends. The online retail titan has aggressively shed costs to bolster its profit margins during the recent lull in e-commerce. These expense-reduction initiatives should position Amazon -- and its shareholders -- to profit handsomely as it gains retail market share in the years ahead.

Buy These 2 Growth Stocks By Dave Kovaleski \u2013 May 17, 2023 at 7:15AM Key Points Amazon has generated a 23% annualized return over the past 10 years and dominates in two markets. Visa is the largest payment processor in the the world and has a sizable moat. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMZN Amazon.com Market Cap $1,185B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.94%)\u00a0$2.24 Current\u00a0Price $117.74 Price as of May 18, 2023, 10:50 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These two giants are leaders within their respective industries. If you are new to investing, you'll find there is a lot to learn, but you will also discover that investing doesn't really have to be that complicated. These two ideas seem at odds with one another but both can be true. Wall Street tends to make things more complicated than they need to be, but if you take a long-term view and focus on good, solid companies, you can have success -- and learn as you go. An excellent way to get started is by investing in an exchange-traded fund that tracks a broad index like the S&P 500, because that gives you access to the biggest and best companies. But if you want to dip your toe into individual stocks, here are two great ones for beginners. 1. Amazon Online retailer Amazon (AMZN 1.94%) is the fourth-largest company in the U.S. with a market cap of $1.1 trillion. Just last year, it became much more accessible to the average or new investor when it implemented a 20-for-1 stock split, which means the stock price was cut by a factor of 20 as each existing shareholder was given 20 shares for each share they held. At the time the split was announced, one share of Amazon was trading at about $2,500. The split was effective last June, and each share now trades for about $115. Nothing fundamentally changed about the company as a result of the split, but it did was make the stock accessible to more investors who couldn't afford or didn't want to pay $2,500 for a single share. That stock split coincided with a bear market that brought Amazon all the way down to $83 per share at the end of 2022. This year, the stock price is up about 35%. Investors have an incredible opportunity to buy one of the best companies on Earth -- one that has returned 23% per year during the past 20 years versus about 10% for the S&P 500 -- at a relatively affordable entry point. Amazon still has the massive advantages that made it one of the best companies in the world. It is by far the leader in e-commerce, with a market share of 38%, while the next closest competitor is Walmart at 6%. With the e-commerce market expected to expand 12% annually between now and 2027, Amazon should see the lion's share of that growth. Also, Amazon Web Services is the biggest player in the cloud computing business with a 34% market share, which it increased last year. The next largest is Microsoft with a 21% share. The global cloud computing market is expected to expand by 16% per year between now and 2032, so there are even bigger growth opportunities for the market leader here. 2. Visa Payment processing giant Visa (V 0.29%) is another top 10 company in terms of market cap. It's a name you recognize, and it offers a product you use almost every day. If you are new to investing, here are a few things you should know about Visa and why it has been so dominant over the past few decades. Visa has what is called a moat around its business, which means that it is insulated and protected from competition. It is one of only four credit card companies, and is by far the largest of the bunch, with some 53% of all total purchase volume occurring on its network. The second closest is Mastercard, with about 24% of purchase volume. The two companies account for more than three-quarters of the total volume. The other advantage is its business model. Visa, along with Mastercard, is not a credit issuer, meaning it does not provide the credit for the purchase when the card is used. That is done by the issuing bank, such Capital One or Bank of America. When you pay off your card, you pay back those banks. Visa and Mastercard partner with those issuers, providing the network for processing transactions. Visa generates revenue on every transaction, taking a so-called swipe fee, so it has none of the credit risk that banks have in lending the money. It is an extremely simple business model with low risk, and it generates huge operating margins because outside of employees and technology, it doesn't have a lot of physical overhead, such as manufacturing facilities. Visa has been able to generate about an 18% annual return over the past 10 years, which far outpaces the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite. And with the world gradually moving away from cash to online and digital transactions, Visa is in prime position to grow with this trend. Amazon and Visa have been very good to investors over the years and both are well positioned to continue their dominance in the years ahead. A new investor could do a lot worse than starting with these two blue chip stocks. Bank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

Learn More These companies might not be the biggest names in gaming but could offer substantial gains over the long term. Inflation has eased for 10 consecutive months, with prices rising 4.9% in April after hitting a high of 9.1% in June 2022. As economic headwinds gradually improve, so, too, will consumer-reliant markets like the video game industry. Easing inflation should allow players to increase discretionary spending, so now is a prime time to add a gaming stock to your portfolio before it's too late. Titans of the industry like Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo have long dominated gaming with the popularity of their respective consoles. However, lesser-known game companies that focus on other aspects of the market might offer more substantial gains over the long term as they could have more room to grow. Here are two under-the-radar gaming stocks you can buy and hold for the next decade. 1. Nvidia Nvidia (NVDA 3.01%) has captured Wall Street's attention this year. Its potential in artificial intelligence (AI) sent the company's stock soaring more than 94% since Jan. 1. However, long before the current AI boom, Nvidia was best known for its position in PC gaming\u00a0-- as a leader in graphics processing units (GPUs). The popularity of Nvidia's GPUs allowed it to capture an 88% market share in the consumer market as of the third quarter of 2022. Its dominant role in the industry hurt the company amid steep declines in the PC market last year, which was brought down by macroeconomic headwinds. As a result, Nvidia's gaming segment reported a 27% year-over-year decline in revenue of $9 billion in fiscal 2022. However, the figure was an improvement on 2020's gaming revenue of $7.7 billion, suggesting the company remained on a growth path despite the economic downturn. Additionally, the segment will likely continue recovering and expanding as inflation improves. Moreover, Nvidia has another lucrative role in gaming as the exclusive supplier of chips to the Nintendo Switch console. Since the gaming machine's debut in 2017, 126 million units have been sold, making it the third-bestselling console ever. Nintendo is expected to release a sequel to the Switch within the next two years, which could offer Nvidia a revenue boost it remains the console's chip provider. Nvidia sports an attractive forward price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 0.4, which makes it a compelling way to invest in the game industry. Meanwhile, the company's position as a leading chipmaker makes it an excellent stock to buy now and hold indefinitely. 2. Amazon Amazon (AMZN 1.85%) is probably fairly down the list of companies that come to mind when considering the games market. However, the e-commerce giant has had significant success in game development and with its video game live-streaming platform, Twitch. The company founded Amazon Games in 2012, focusing on game publishing and development. It initially struggled to capture player interest but landed a hit with the launch of the online game New World in September 2021. The popular title sold 4.5 million copies in its first month, raking in more than $150 million. The success seemingly set Amazon Games on a lucrative path, as the company recently announced that a Lord of the Rings-themed game in the same genre as New World is under development. Moreover, Amazon's 2014 acquisition of Twitch made the company the leader in the $12 billion games live-streaming industry. In 2022, the platform generated an estimated $2.8 billion, garnering 7.6 million users every month. Twitch has given Amazon a solid position in gaming, and the platform is continuing to grow in popularity alongside the rise of live streaming. Additionally, the service is a useful tool for Amazon to market newly developed games to mass audiences. An economic downturn last year dragged down Amazon shares considerably. However, easing inflation will likely offer investors significant gains as the company recovers. Analysts seem to agree: The company's average 12-month price target is $138, projecting a stock rise of about 24%. Considering this, as well as its leading market share in e-commerce and the cloud market, Amazon is an attractive under-the-radar gaming stock you can hold for the long term.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Agree Realty, Stag Industrial, and Mid-American Apartment Communities can provide steady income and long-term growth without you watching. Watching your kids may be a higher priority for you than watching the stock market, but that doesn't mean a busy parent has to miss out on the proven power of long-term investing in the form of buying and holding great stocks. There are plenty of opportunities out there for buying shares of companies that don't require the close monitoring that goes into successfully navigating the very wide world of individual stocks. Better yet, some of them provide a nice flow of passive income, or money you generate from an investment while not actively managing it yourself. In this case, that income comes from dividends. Three solid dividend investments to consider here are Agree Realty (O -0.13%), Stag Industrial (STAG 0.67%), and Mid-American Apartment Communities (MAA 0.06%). Rolling forward with REITs All three of these are real estate investment trusts (REITs), which means they own pools of income-producing properties and are mandated by tax law to pay at least 90% of their taxable income to shareholders in the form of dividends. Dividends combine with movement in share price to produce a key metric called total return. The chart below shows how each of these REITs has performed in that regard over the past 15 years, since the onset of the Great Recession. Here we're using the Dow Jones Industrial Average as a benchmark and expressing the gains in terms of how much a $1,000 investment would have grown over that time assuming the reinvestment of dividends. MAA Total Return Level data by YCharts These three REITs share strong performance records but they're in very different businesses, adding diversity to that part of your investment portfolio. 1. Agree Realty Agree Realty develops, owns, and leases properties to retailers, and has built a collection of 1,908 properties across 48 states. A Who's Who of reliable tenants led by the likes of Walmart, Dollar General, and Tractor Supply provide a growing flow of recession-resistant income to Agree through net leases, a model in which the occupants pay such costs as insurance, maintenance, and real estate taxes. Over the years, this retail REIT has grown its reputation as a passive income machine, boosting its payouts by an average of about 6% a year for the past 10 years. At recent prices, Agree's stock is yielding roughly 4.3%. 2. Stag Industrial Then there's Stag Industrial, a member of the industrial REIT sector. These trusts own warehouses, distribution centers, and manufacturing facilities. The logistics part of this business has been particularly hot since the pandemic supercharged e-commerce. Demand also remains strong for factory space in response to the onshoring of manufacturing that became imperative because of COVID-19-induced supply chain issues. Stag Industrial currently owns 563 distribution centers, warehouses, and factories in 41 states, and its tenants include a wide variety of e-commerce shippers and manufacturers, including behemoths like Amazon. Stag stock is paying about a 4.2% dividend yield. 3. Mid-American Apartment Communities Mid-American Apartment Communities, or MAA, is a residential REIT and it's one of the largest owners of multifamily properties in the country, with a portfolio of about 102,000 units. Those 300 apartment communities are largely in strong Sunbelt markets such as Nashville, Austin, Houston, Dallas, Orlando, Tampa, Charlotte, and Atlanta. MAA has paid 117 straight quarterly cash dividends and has raised the payout for the past 13 years. The stock yields roughly 3.7% at recent prices. Building wealth the Foolish way Dividend investing is a proven way to build wealth over time, especially when the money is entrusted to well-run companies that have the means to continue their strong performance through good times and bad. In fact, that's a cornerstone of the Motley Fool's investing philosophy. The three REITs above fit that bill, plus they provide a shot of income -- monthly, in the case of Agree and Stag Industrial -- and don't require a lot of monitoring, leaving you the time to pay attention to more pressing matters while you just let the nest egg grow.

Vulcan will be the successor to ULA\u2019s Delta IV and Atlas V rockets. ULA was set up in 2006 as a joint venture between Boeing Co. BA, +0.03% and Lockheed Martin Corp. LMT, -0.56%. Since then, the company\u2019s Delta and Atlas rockets have been used to send more than 150 missions into orbit. \u201cI expect we will see that [first Vulcan] launch sometime between summer and later this year,\u201d Bruno said during a streamed interview at the Human to Mars Summit in Washington on Tuesday. ULA had initially planned for a Vulcan debut launch in May, but that was pushed back when a Vulcan rocket\u2019s upper stage suffered an anomaly during testing at NASA\u2019s Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama in March, according to Space.com. The explosion was first reported by Ars Technica. Bruno subsequently tweeted that a hydrogen leak caused an explosion during the test. Space.com reported that the upper stage that exploded was not part of the hardware for the debut Vulcan launch. \u201cWe will sort that out, we will resolve it,\u201d Bruno said Tuesday. Related: Virgin Galactic sets sights on first commercial launch ULA undertook Vulcan rocket tests to simulate a launch day at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station last week. Vulcan\u2019s booster propulsion is provided by a pair of BE-4 engines manufactured by Blue Origin, which was founded by Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +2.10% founder Jeff Bezos. \u201cI am very happy with my partner there,\u201d said Bruno. The BE-4 engines use liquid oxygen and liquefied natural gas, a commercially available form of methane. Unlike other rocket propellants, such as kerosene, liquefied natural gas eliminates the need for expensive and complex pressurization systems, such as helium, which is in increasingly scarce supply, according to ULA. The new ULA rocket also integrates up to six Northrop Grumman Corp. NOC, -0.71% Solid Rocket Boosters, or SRBs. Speaking at the Humans to Mars Summit, Bruno also discussed ULA\u2019s contract with Amazon to support its Project Kuiper, which will launch a constellation of 3,236 satellites into low Earth orbit. The deal, which was announced last year, will see the Vulcan rocket used for 38 launches.

Here's How Much You'd Have Nowby Chris Katje, Benzinga Staff Writer\u00a0 May 16, 2023 4:30 PM |  3 min read Zinger Key PointsAmazon went public on May 15, 1997 with an initial price offering.The company was unprofitable at the time of its IPO and had around 340,000 customer accounts. Leading ecommerce company Amazon.com Inc AMZN is one of the most valuable companies on the face of the earth. Years ago, the company was unprofitable and valued at less than $500 million. While it\u2019s hard to believe the company once was that small, every great company has to start somewhere.Here\u2019s a look back at the company\u2019s IPO and how investors have done if they stuck around with their Amazon shares.What Happened: Amazon went public on May 15, 1997 with an initial price offering. The company offered shares at a price point of $18 and a company valuation of around $300 million.A look back at Amazon at the time of its IPO shows that the company had around 80,000 average daily visits to its website, 256 employees and annual revenue of $15.8 million.In its IPO filing, Amazon said it was \u201cthe leading online retailer of books.\u201d\u201cAmazon strives to offer its customers compelling value through innovative use of technology, broad selection, high-quality content, a high level of customer service, competitive pricing and personalized services,\u201d the filing also said. The company had 340,000 customer accounts from 100 countries at the time of its public offering filing.Related Link: Amazon Q1 Earnings Highlights: Revenue And EPS Beat, AWS Up 16% YoY, Q2 Guidance And MoreAmazon was founded in 1995 by\u00a0Jeff Bezos after he quit\u00a0his job at an investment firm to open an online book store called Amazon.com. Bezos moved to Seattle, drafting the initial business plan for Amazon during his cross-country trip from New York to Seattle. In 1995, around 300 of Bezos\u2019 friends performed beta testing for Amazon.com.The rest, as they say, is history. Amazon is now the fifth most valuable public company with a market capitalization of $1.17 trillion.The company has grown through new product offerings like Amazon Prime Video and Amazon Web Services and through expanding internationally. Amazon has also been aggressive with acquisitions over the years, acquiring companies like Alexa, Audible, Twitch, Whole Foods, Pill Pack and MGM.Investing $1,000 in Amazon IPO: Investors who bought Amazon shares at the time of the company\u2019s IPO have done quite well, but also would have had to weather through the dot-com bubble. A bubble of tech companies, including many dot-com names, wiped out competitors of Amazon and also saw shares of the ecommerce company fall significantly.Investors who bought $1,000 of Amazon shares at the time of its IPO could have bought 18.55 AMZN shares based on the $18 price point.Stock splits of Amazon in June 1998 (2:1), January 1999 (3:1), September 1999 (2:1) and June 2022 (20:1) would have turned the 18.55 AMZN shares into 13,334.4 shares today.Based on a price of $113.92 for Amazon shares at the time of writing, the $1,000 investment would be worth $1,519,054.85 today.Not a bad return for investing $1,000 in an unprofitable online bookseller.Read Next: How Much Stock Did Amazon Chief Andy Jassy Get Awarded In FY22?

of estimates of a 0.8% increase. Major hedge funds' managers raised their bets on US tech giants last quarter.

\u2013 Should You Too? A Look At DDS And GMEby Ryan Glosier, Benzinga Staff Writer May 16, 2023 11:31 AM |  7 min read The \u201csell everything brick and mortar\u201d theme has been playing out on Wall Street for the better part of a decade and the casualties have absolutely piled up, with Bed Bath and Beyond being the latest. In fact, it was this thematic trade that took down Melvin Capital and made GameStop GME, a struggling video-game retailer, a name that will go down in infamy on the Street, no matter how the company\u2019s future ends up playing out.\u00a0The thesis remains and is straightforward \u2013 Amazon AMZN and others that make up the e-commerce ecosystem have taken a tremendous bite out of brick-and-mortar retail traffic and sales. A screen of attractive short opportunities based on current technicals, not surprisingly, turned up the usual suspects in this area, and traders should take a closer look as the market is weakening again and the American consumer is facing some very serious headwinds.\u00a0In fact, it has been rather shocking how well household spending has held up amid rapidly tightening credit conditions, rising mortgage rates, a bad year for the stock market in 2022 and record inflation. How much longer can this continue? Will the prognostications of a looming recession come to pass as a result of a tapped-out consumer, with the near-term spark being financial contagion in the banking system? It would certainly seem possible, perhaps even likely.\u00a0A screen of mid-cap brick-and-mortar retail stocks with a current short-interest above 15% turned up a number of unsurprising names, most of whom have sustained significant technical damage in recent months and appear set to move even lower if the much-anticipated pullback in U.S. equities is upon us. Below, we examine two well-known brick-and-mortar retailers that turned up on the screen and delve into the technical and fundamental stories that are driving short-sellers to bet on lower prices heading into the Summer of 2023.\u00a0\u00a0Dillard\u2019s DDSThe long-term chart of this semi-iconic fashion retailer may seem a bit surprising, as the stock has been a tremendous long-term performer despite persistent industry headwinds. Dillard\u2019s could just as well be on a list of long ideas. But the near-term technical picture has been deteriorating and short-sellers are targeting the stock with short-interest sitting just above 15%. Furthermore, given the broad economic conditions highlighted above, it seems unlikely that DDS would be able to withstand a consumer recession unscathed, not to mention market turmoil and volatility. Dillard\u2019s has surged around 7,400% since its 1983 debut, with a good portion of those gains coming amid a truly eye-opening rally in the stock that began in the spring of 2020.\u00a0In that period of time, DDS has gone from multi-year lows of around $30.00 to close Monday\u2019s trading session at just above $291.00. A cursory review of how that could have happened reveals that sales at the anchor retailer bottomed out in 2021 and have risen since then to $7 billion.\u00a0Furthermore, Dillard\u2019s has done a far better job of converting sales into earnings in the last two years as net income jumped from a loss of ~$71 million reported in 2021 to a profit of ~$862 million in 2022 and then ~$892 million in 2023 \u2013 certainly impressive growth.\u00a0Nevertheless, the near-term picture is shaping up in such a way that DDS finds itself on a list of short ideas amid expectations of weakening economic conditions and tightening consumer credit.\u00a0The company\u2019s wildly improved market cap, currently just under $5 billion, may make it even more attractive on the short side after its huge rally in recent years. Year-to-date, shares are down over 8% and the stock made a new low for 2023 last week, prior to a modest rally on Monday.\u00a0Surprisingly, or maybe not surprisingly, this stock is not widely followed on the Street, with Yahoo Finance providing only three analyst estimates for sales and earnings in the coming years. Furthermore, of the three analysts, EPS and sales estimates vary widely, suggesting a lack of visibility \u2013 and hence a potential opportunity.\u00a0The consensus, however, is that both EPS and sales will be declining in the coming years. Wall Street has consensus EPS estimates for the current fiscal year of $35.63 vs. $50.81 in the year ago period.\u00a0This yields a P/E of ~8 using this year\u2019s estimates. Next year, the Street sees EPS falling 22% to $27.79. Sales this year are projected to be $6.67 billion and then decline another 1.6% to $6.56 billion in fiscal 2025.\u00a0Obviously, things are not heading in the right direction here, and downside economic surprises could give DDS a haircut in a hurry. Near-term momentum remains bearish, with the stock holding below the 50 and 200-day sma, recording an RSI (14) of 44.29, and a 4% decline for the month.\u00a0At the very least, this will be a name to continue to watch as a long-term support level in the $300.00 area has recently been violated to the downside, making the technical picture even more precarious in the coming weeks.\u00a0GameStop GME\u00a0Surely, the appearance of the infamous GME ticker symbol will draw many eyes. Is GME iconic? Famous? Infamous? On Wall Street, Reddit, in stock trading circles, and the broader online ecosystem, GME is all of those things, and for good reason!\u00a0Most are familiar with the GME story, and it\u2019s reminiscent of many many other brick-and-mortar retailers \u2013 the business has been struggling with a large, unprofitable, and unwieldy portfolio of retail locations that have translated into falling sales and losses for years.\u00a0Nevertheless, even in its current state, GME can still generate revenue - just under $6 billion in fiscal 2023. But it can\u2019t make money. From an economic and corporate standpoint, a miracle would still be required to justify the company\u2019s current ~$6 billion market cap.\u00a0Let\u2019s take a look at the technical picture here and see what the future may hold for the stock.\u00a0\u00a0GameStop reported better than anticipated earnings on March 22, sending shares gapping up significantly on the news. The price action since, however, has confirmed continued bearish sentiment in this name.\u00a0On that day, after a huge gap, the stock fell throughout the session and closed on intraday lows. The momentum to the downside accelerated throughout most of April, and it appeared as if GME was setting up to take a run at the $17.65 level, where it closed prior to the release of that earnings report.\u00a0Over the last 10 days, however, the stock has found a strong bid and has now re-taken both the 20 and 50-day moving average. On Monday, GME closed the session up another 4.5% to $21.62. In 2022, GME executed a 4-1 stock split, so this equates to a price above $80.00 in pre-split terms.\u00a0Not surprisingly, short interest remains elevated in the name, with nearly 22% of the float being sold short \u2013 a somewhat stunning figure given what happened in 2021 and ongoing prognostications of another short-squeeze of even more epic proportions (which appears extremely unlikely).\u00a0The share price has fallen a little better than 6% over the course of the last month and the stock continues to trade well below the 200-day SMA, but momentum has certainly been turning up, although not dramatically. Year-to-date, GameStop shares have now climbed almost 26%, but on the 52-week chart, the stock remains down around 6%.A short position in GME at current levels would appear risky given the underlying shareholder fundamentals in the name, whereby an army of retail traders continues to be long the stock, seemingly tying up a significant portion of the float, vowing not to sell.\u00a0Nevertheless, valuation remains extremely stretched here using any and all metrics and clearly there are many traders on Wall Street that have not been dissuaded from attempting to make money in the name at the expense of the WallStreetBets crowd.

It is riding on the e-commerce and cloud computing tailwinds for growth. Amazon can count on smaller businesses for growth. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMZN Amazon.com Market Cap $1,185B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.85%)\u00a0$2.13 Current\u00a0Price $117.64 Price as of May 18, 2023, 10:53 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Despite its size, Amazon still has room for further expansion. Amazon (AMZN 1.85%), the e-commerce giant, has seen its stock price fall by more than 40% from its all-time high in mid-2021. Bargain hunters are sniffing around for potential bargain purchases. But before making any move, they should know these two essential things that intelligent investors know about Amazon. Image source: Getty Images. 1. The origins of Amazon's economic machine Amazon has been a significant success over the last two decades. It went from operating an online bookstore to becoming a global e-commerce giant with a diversified business in various industries. Launched as an online bookstore in 1995, Amazon quickly expanded its product offerings to include a wide range of items. And thanks to its low-price strategy, it gradually became the go-to destination for online shopping. But it didn't stop there. The tech company introduced Amazon Marketplace, allowing third-party sellers to reach customers through the platform. This move significantly increased the selection of products available to customers and solidified Amazon's competitive position as a comprehensive online retail destination. To further delight customers, Amazon launched Amazon Prime in 2005. This subscription service offered customers free two-day shipping on eligible products. The idea was to provide subscribers with free and fast delivery -- turns out they love it. Prime membership has since become a significant driver of customer loyalty, incentivizing repeat purchases and contributing to the growth of Amazon's ecosystem. Over time, Prime added other benefits, such as access to streaming services like Prime Video and Prime Music, becoming even more valuable to subscribers. Another significant move Amazon made was to launch its cloud computing business -- Amazon Web Services (AWS) -- in 2006. As the first mover, AWS quickly became the preferred service provider for companies wanting to benefit from cloud computing. Over time, AWS added new features to its platform, making its services increasingly indispensable to its customers. Amazon's relentless focus on innovation and customer delight has resulted in a diversified business model with multiple income streams. Out of the $127 billion in revenue in the first quarter of 2023, 40% came from online sales, 23% from third-party seller fees, 17% from AWS, 8% from subscription fees, 8% from advertising services, and the remaining amount from other services. 2. Amazon's prospects in the next few years Amazon's track record of growth has been nothing but incredible. From just $511,000 in 1995, Amazon grew its revenue to $514 billion in 2022. In the last decade alone, revenue was up by more than eight-fold. While Amazon is unlikely to grow at its historical pace in the future, thanks to its already giant size, there is potential for the company to expand further. Let's first look at the e-commerce business. Amazon is the clear leader in the U.S., with around 38% of the e-commerce market share as of June 2022. While it doesn't have that much room to expand its e-commerce share, it is important to note that e-commerce only accounts for around 15% of total retail sales. So effectively, Amazon's retail market share is less than 6%, giving it plenty of room to grow. Beyond that, Amazon can grow its e-commerce business in overseas markets, some of which have even lower e-commerce penetration rates. For example, Amazon is investing heavily in India -- a massive country with 1.4 billion people, a low e-commerce penetration rate, and a growing per-capita gross domestic product. Another huge area for growth is cloud computing. According to Market.us, global cloud computing was worth $546 billion in 2022 and could reach $2.3 billion by 2032. AWS generated $80 billion in revenue in 2022, giving it plenty of room to ride this tailwind in the next decade. Amazon can also count on its small but fast-growing advertising business to account for a more significant share of the group's revenue. In the first quarter of 2023, this segment grew 23%, while groupwide revenue grew by just 11%. Beyond that, the conglomerate can depend on its innovation engine to introduce new products and services in robotics, autonomous vehicles, and artificial intelligence. Long story short: Amazon's growth machine will likely keep going for a while. What this means for investors Amazon is one of the most remarkable companies of our time. From a small online bookstore, it has become the top dog in multiple industries, including e-commerce and cloud computing. While Amazon's historical growth pace may not continue, it still has plenty of room to expand its e-commerce business locally and in overseas markets and ride the tailwind of cloud computing growth. Investors should keep the company on their radar. John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool\u2019s board of directors.

The story has been corrected. Here\u2019s what is holding up   stock market. Getty Images/iStockphoto Disappointing retail sales and more debt-ceiling talks are the big spotlight for Tuesday, with stocks off to a weaker start. There was also some disappointing China data that showed a slowing recovery. Dipping a toe into how investors are feeling these days is the latest fund manager survey from Bank of America. Strategist Michael Hartnett and his team reveal that investor sentiment deteriorated in May to \u201cthe most bearish of 2023\u201d as investors lifted cash balances and got a little more negative on growth.  They say that is good news \u2014 \u201cpositioning still contrarian [positive] for Wall Street.\u201d Worried managers are convinced that risk assets will remain \u201cresilient so long as the [economic] landing is soft.\u201d  The below BofA chart shows nearly two-thirds of those surveyed \u2014 63% \u2014 see a soft landing as the most likely outcome for the global economy. And 61% are convinced the Fed has finished hiking, while 43% say perhaps not.  The next chart might explain why the market is taking that Alfred E. Neuman approach to debt-ceiling talks, baffling some on Wall Street, as 71% expect the ceiling will be raised by the so-called X date: So where are the worries in this teflon market? A bank credit crunch and a global recession are at the top, followed by high inflation that keeps central banks hawkish. If there is a credit event, most of those surveyed think it will start in the commercial real estate corner.  As for where this market is looking crowded \u2014 the past month saw a big rotation out of commodities linked to those growth worries \u2014 and into stocks. The emphasis was on tech names, with an overweight that\u2019s the highest since December 2021, alongside a move into eurozone stocks. Investors are most long on growth versus value stocks since July 2020. No doubt, some out there have been questioning whether technology stocks can keep up the pace \u2014 the Nasdaq Composite COMP is still up a whopping 18% so far this year, while the S&P 500 SPX is up just over 7%.  For those contrarians out there,  the trades would be bullish positions on real estate investment trusts, banks and value stocks, and going the opposite way of the crowd by shorting bonds, technology and growth.

Here's What Could Be Coming. By Keith Speights \u2013 May 16, 2023 at 5:52AM Key Points The market breadth of the S&P 500 is at its weakest level ever based on some measures. This could point to coming downturns for the U.S. economy and stock market. Investors don't need to panic, though. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,716B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.81%)\u00a0$1.41 Current\u00a0Price $174.09 Price as of May 18, 2023, 10:52 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Many stocks aren't participating in the S&P 500 rally. You don't have to look hard to find discouraging economic and market indicators. For example, the three-month/10-year U.S. Treasury yield curve is inverted the most in decades. This typically portends bad news for the economy. But there's\u00a0one stock market indicator that has never been worse. And here's what could be coming. Image source: Getty Images. Market breadth J.P. Morgan recently cautioned its clients that market breadth is \"the weakest ever\" based on some measures. The firm's chief U.S. equity strategist, Dubravko Lakos-Bujas, warned that this could point to a \"bearish outcome for the market.\" Market breadth is a term used to describe how many stocks are participating in a move for a stock market index. There are several ways to measure market breadth. One common method is to count the number of stocks that are rising versus the number of stocks that are declining. JPMorgan analysts were particularly looking at the percentage of stocks in the S&P 500 that have outperformed the overall index in the latest rally. Why is weak market breadth potentially bad news? It reflects that investors are only excited about a relatively small number of stocks rather than the broader market. In the past when this has been the case, economic downturns have often followed. In a truly healthy market, a high percentage of stocks will perform well instead of only a few. The haves and the have-nots There are two main reasons why the S&P 500's market breadth is so weak right now. First, a handful of big stocks make up a significant percentage of the total index value. Apple (AAPL 0.81%) and Microsoft (MSFT 0.59%) alone comprise close to 14.5% of the S&P's value. The top 10 companies in the S&P 500 make up nearly one-third of the index's total value. Second, several of these mega-large-cap stocks have been big winners so far in 2023. Shares of Meta Platforms (META 0.19%) and Nvidia (NVDA 3.01%) have almost doubled year to date. Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet (GOOG 0.91%) (GOOGL 0.89%), Amazon (AMZN 1.85%), and Tesla (TSLA 0.04%) stocks are up more than 25%. AAPL data by YCharts Indeed, the top 10 stocks in the S&P 500 have generated nearly 90% of the index's total return so far in 2023. That's an all-time record. Meanwhile, 341 stocks that are in the S&P 500 have underperformed the overall index this year. Nearly half of the S&P's member stocks are in negative territory year to date. Well over 100 S&P 500 stocks are down by at least 10%. We're seeing a market driven by the \"haves\" and the \"have-nots.\" Many of the \"haves\" are surging due to investors' enthusiasm for AI. Many of the \"have-nots\" have fallen as a result of the banking crisis. What should investors do? If analysts are right that an economic downturn could be on the way, one pragmatic strategy for investors is to move their money into recession-proof stocks. These include consumer staples, healthcare, and utility stocks. Perhaps the best approach is the one that Warren Buffett is taking to prepare for a recession. Build up a cash stockpile to take advantage of potential buying opportunities. Don't panic. And, above all, have a long-term outlook. What matters more than the breadth of the market is the length of time you're in the market. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

By Adria Cimino \u2013 May 16, 2023 at 5:30AM Key Points Shiba Inu wowed investors with an enormous gain in 2021 but since has struggled. Potential catalysts this year -- such as a metaverse project -- so far haven\u2019t offered the meme token a boost. Motley Fool Issues Rare \u201cAll In\u201d Buy Alert CRYPTO: SHIB Shiba Inu Market Cap $5B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (%) Current\u00a0Price $0.00 Price as of May 18, 2023, 11:07 a.m. ET You\u2019re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool\u2019s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Investors still wonder if Shiba Inu may repeat its earlier spectacular performance. When crypto investors dream of becoming millionaires, they often think of Shiba Inu (SHIB). The popular meme token brought some investors wealth when it soared 45,000,000% back in 2021. Since, though, the crypto with a cute dog mascot has lost that momentum. And the big question is whether Shiba Inu will ever get it back. The crypto actually is better today than when it soared in value. It's launched a metaverse project, and its layer-2 solution, Shibarium, is in beta test mode. Still, these elements have failed to push Shiba Inu higher. Is it time to sell? Let's find out. Shiba Inu's glory days First, a look back at Shiba Inu's glory days. A veil of mystery surrounded the crypto from its launch: We know of the founder only by the pseudonym \"Ryoshi.\" That and the mascot helped push Shiba Inu into the spotlight. Some social media attention from Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk helped too. Finally, loyal fans known as the \"Shib Army\" supported Shiba Inu across social media platforms -- and helped boost the token's popularity. Of course, seeing Shiba Inu's enormous gains, investors, fearful of missing out, piled in. And it was easy to do that considering the token traded for a fraction of a cent -- and this is still the case, even after the 2021 gains. Shiba Inu fulfilled the promise of its whitepaper, becoming an example of \"decentralized spontaneous community building.\" So, why hasn't Shiba Inu continued climbing? For a few reasons. The general economic environment last year didn't favor risky assets such as cryptocurrencies. When the economy weakens, investors generally head for safety. So assets like dividend stocks or healthcare players benefit. All of this weighed on the entire crypto market. But that isn't the only problem. In fact, that's probably the smallest problem -- because it's temporary and not linked specifically to Shiba Inu. The bigger issues for Shiba Inu are the facts that it doesn't stand out from other cryptocurrencies, doesn't have many use cases, and struggles with a huge token supply. Shiba Inu is primarily a payment token -- and even there, only a limited number of merchants accept this kind of payment. Otherwise, investors can stake their holding for passive income. Rivals offer the same opportunities -- and often much more. An enormous token supply As for circulating token supply, Shiba Inu's tops 589 trillion. The problem here is that limits gains in value. For example, if Shiba Inu were to climb to $1, its market value would be worth $589 trillion -- way more than the entire cryptocurrency market and even massive companies like Apple or Amazon. In recent times, though, Shiba Inu has made progress in countering these challenges. The crypto introduced its metaverse project, which today allows people to buy land and later will feature gaming and events. Shiba Inu's Shibarium allows developers to build decentralized applications on the layer-2, is low cost, and has a mechanism for burning tokens (the idea here is to lower token supply). The good news is Shiba Inu has launched these projects. The bad news is they haven't been catalysts to lift the value of the cryptocurrency. In fact, Shiba Inu has slippped about 20% over the past month. If these efforts weren't enough to give Shiba Inu a boost, it's hard to imagine what might lift this meme token in the coming months. But it isn't too surprising that these developments haven't driven Shiba Inu higher. They're positive events for sure. But they still don't solve the problems I mentioned above. If Shiba Inu doesn't stand out from rivals and the token supply remains high, it's unlikely this crypto will define the cryptocurrency market of tomorrow. So, should you sell? The answer to this depends on your financial situation, comfort with risk, and gains or losses on Shiba Inu so far. Investors who have won on their investment or haven't lost much probably would be better off selling. If you're looking at a potentially big loss and can accept that, you also may consider exiting now. Otherwise, you may prefer sticking around -- it's possible Shiba Inu will recover somewhat if Shibarium and the metaverse project take off. In any case, today I wouldn't buy Shiba Inu. The cryptocurrency world\u00a0offers other better opportunities. John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Meanwhile, Disney seems to be on a growth path after a string of wins at the box office. Comcast's larger focus on content production could pay off in its film and theme park segments.

Learn More These companies have suffered amid an economic downturn, but recent declines have only increased the value of their stocks. Steep rises in inflation since last year have been tough on both consumers and companies, and reduced spending has resulted in weak earnings reports this month. However, consistently easing inflation could mean that now is a prime time to buy cheap stocks that have the potential to soar once macroeconomic headwinds subside. The consumer price index rose 4.9% in April, easing after hitting a high of 9.1% in June 2022. The improvement is especially encouraging for consumer-reliant companies hit hard by economic declines. For instance, Amazon (AMZN 2.00%) suffered substantial losses in its e-commerce segments last year. Yet its average 12-month price target from professional analysts of $138 reflects vast potential, projecting a 25% stock rise. So, looking for a bargain? Here are three high-growth stocks that are on sale now. 1. Amazon Amazon has been hit particularly hard over the last year. Its North American and international segments reported nearly $10.6 billion in operating losses in fiscal 2022. The company has worked to combat these losses with job cuts totaling 27,000, dozens of warehouse closures, and sunsetting projects like its telehealth service, Amazon Care. These moves have gradually begun to pay off, aided by easing inflation. The first quarter of 2023 brought Amazon's North American segment back to profitability and handed its international segment a marginal improvement. But slowing profit growth in the company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, was a low point of the quarter. However, easing inflation will likely allow the company's e-commerce and cloud segments to flourish over the long term when consumers and businesses feel able to spend more freely. Amazon's attractive 12-month price is proof of its potential, making its stock a bargain amid an economic downturn that won't last forever. 2. Disney Like Amazon, Disney (DIS 1.29%) has had a challenging few years. First, the company endured park and theater closures during the COVID-19 pandemic. Then economic headwinds became detrimental to its streaming efforts, and Disney+ shed 4 million subscribers in the second quarter of 2023. The repeated hits led the company's stock to slip more than 10% in the last five years. However, events of the past five years are unlikely to repeat, so its investors hope the company is back on a growth path. Disney shares climbed 35% over the last decade despite recent hurdles, making it a solid long-term investment. Disney continues to deliver popular content, with Avatar: The Way of Water generating $2.2 billion in February to become the third-highest-grossing film of all time. Meanwhile, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, released on May 5, is on pace to surpass $520 million in its second weekend. Despite Disney's recent difficulties, revenue grew 13% year over year to $22 billion in Q2 2023, and operating income hit $3.3 billion. An improving economic environment, along with a planned price hike in its streaming business this year, additional layoffs, and multiple blockbusters on the way, could be positive developments for Disney's stock. The entertainment giant's growth potential is reflected in its average 12-month price target of nearly $126, which projects stock growth of 37%. As a result, now is an excellent time to take advantage of this bargain growth stock. 3. Comcast Comcast (CMCSA 0.65%) is perhaps best known for its cable and broadband businesses, which suffered amid linear declines and have made the company seem like a risky investment. However, its gradual transition to wireless services and content production over the years made it a company to watch. As the home of NBCUniversal, Comcast has seen increasing success at box offices and its theme parks. The company boasts a content library of lucrative brands such as Jurassic Park, Back to the Future, Fast & Furious, and the animation studio Illumination. The latter was responsible for last month's smash hit, The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which earned $1 billion 26 days after its launch. The box office success comes after Comcast opened Super Nintendo World areas at its Universal Studios theme parks in Japan and California, which will likely see increases in attendance after the film's release. If the company can time a potential sequel with its planned opening of Super Nintendo World in Florida in 2025, the theme parks could become true rivals to Disney parks. In Q1 2023, Comcast earned about $30 billion in revenue, beating analysts' forecasts by $350 million. That complements a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 11, which suggests the company's stock is trading at a major value and that Comcast is an incredibly compelling investment right now.

The industry experienced a slowdown during this tough economic climate. The company operates in a specific segment of the cloud sector, and it's outgrowing its trillion-dollar competitors.

Learn More DigitalOcean is growing faster than Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet in the lucrative cloud industry. Cloud computing is one of the most transformative technologies of our time. Almost every business in the world uses it in some capacity, whether it's to host a website, store data, or even develop software. Businesses are more conscious about how much they invest in their digital capabilities during this tough economic period, causing the cloud industry to experience a slowdown recently. Nonetheless, DigitalOcean (DOCN 2.75%) is one company in the space that continues to deliver robust growth, even outpacing its extremely powerful competitors. DigitalOcean's stock remains down 74% from its all-time high amid the broader sell-off in the technology sector. Here's why that presents a great long-term opportunity for investors. The DigitalOcean difference DigitalOcean competes with the cloud computing divisions of Amazon (AMZN 1.85%), Microsoft (MSFT 0.59%), and Alphabet's (GOOGL 0.89%) (GOOG 0.91%) Google. Each of those companies is worth more than $1 trillion and, therefore, has considerably more resources than DigitalOcean, which has a market capitalization of just $2.9 billion. The company operates in a niche segment of the cloud industry, specifically targeting small to mid-sized businesses with fewer than 500 employees. It offers customers personalized support to guide them through their cloud journey, which includes a library containing thousands of digital resources. DigitalOcean's platform is designed with a host of one-click tools to make deployment simple and easy. It has an affordable and transparent pricing structure suited to its target market. These are features its competitors won't match because they're more focused on serving larger, more complex organizations. DigitalOcean, on the other hand, is an on-ramp to the cloud for start-ups, and its business model relies on a funnel-style revenue structure. The company has around 614,000 customers, which includes 468,000 \"learners\" with average monthly spending of just $15. It relies on a portion of those enterprises becoming \"builders,\" which spend an average of $135 per month. Then, an even smaller portion of those customers becomes successful and transitions into \"scalers\" with much larger budgets -- DigitalOcean has around 15,000 of those with average monthly spending of $1,962. The strategy translates into strong revenue growth for DigitalOcean DigitalOcean is certainly much smaller than the tech giants it's competing with, but it grew faster than all of them in the first quarter of 2023. Its revenue came in at $165.1 million, which was up 30% year over year. By comparison, Amazon Web Services grew its revenue by 16%, Microsoft Azure by 27%, and Google Cloud by 28% in the same period. DigitalOcean is also close to profitability on a GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) basis. While it made a net loss of $34.9 million in Q1, after stripping out one-off and non-cash expenses like restructuring charges and stock-based compensation, it actually generated non-GAAP net income of $28.7 million. In an effort to manage costs, the company reduced its marketing spending during Q1 compared to the same time last year. Yet it was able to maintain strong revenue and customer growth, which points to the organic demand for its platform. Why DigitalOcean stock is a buy right now According to Grand View Research, the cloud computing industry could be worth $619 billion this year, with a 14.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) between now and 2030. DigitalOcean operates in a small segment of the overall industry. It estimates the cloud market for small to mid-sized businesses will be worth just $98 billion this year. However, it's expected to grow at a CAGR of 26% until at least 2026, so this cohort is expanding at a much faster rate than the cloud sector overall. That places DigitalOcean in a position to continue outgrowing its competitors, which means it will increase its market share. Some other reasons this stock is a buy: DigitalOcean stock is down 74% from its all-time high. Its revenue continues to expand. The stock trades at a price-to-sales ratio of just 5.3 right now, which is about one-third of its peak valuation of 15.5 from 2021. That means investors can buy the stock at a hefty discount to where it was trading just two years ago, yet its underlying business is stronger than ever. That certainly feels like a great opportunity. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

This Friday is expiration Friday - the date many options expire - so volatility is bound to affect stock movement this week. This is a crucial date for options traders and can have implications for the underlying asset's price and market dynamics. I've pulled up my cheap options scanner and I have a list of stocks that are on my radar. Three things have my full attention - two sectors with potential upside that are seeing some action and a mega-cap that might have a crack in its armor... Here's what's in play for the week of May 15... Sign up for SMS so you never miss special events, exclusive offers, and weekly bonus trades. First off, I want to start with the mid-cap banks. I've been watching this group closely, and while there may be more shoes to drop in this sector, some of these names are really moving. Truist Financial (TFC) and Charles Schwab (SCHW) are both seeing some pretty decent activity and are getting a little bit of a bid. For SCHW, I'm looking for a move back up to $60 over the next couple of weeks. That's a move of around 17%. For TFC, I'm looking for shares to pop back to around $32 or $33 from recent prices of around $28. Yes, implied volatility is still high and we could absolutely see banks fall further, but from what I'm seeing, we could see some of these names break out on big volume. The other area where we're seeing some action today is the energy space. Now, this isn't showing up on my cheap options play, but the energy space is definitely getting a little bit of a bid following a decent-sized merger in the midstream areas. Petrobras (PBR) has also seen a ton of activity over the past few weeks. The stock has a huge dividend coming up next week, and that's going to draw some interest. Its latest earnings results, announced on May 11, were good. But there are some other big players here as well - XOM, CVR, MRO, and MPC. These names may be bottoming and could catch some bids after a really rough show. Finally, I'm watching Amazon (AMZN) this week. Implied volatility is at a one-year low, while 20-day volume is trading at a huge premium, and 10-day volume is right at where we're trading. These megacaps have basically been holding up the whole market, and you have to wonder whether at some point these names are going to get a little overdone... and you could see a little bit of a drawback. Now, I like AMZN long-term. It's a really great long-term investment, especially if you were buying it in the $80s and $90 when it was trading down there. But AMZN has put in a 32% run since the start of the year, and we could be looking at a little bit of near-t\u2026 Join the conversation.
