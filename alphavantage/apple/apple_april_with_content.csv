Gurman Weighs In On One Strategy That Could Help Cupertino Win Big In This Frontierby Shanthi Rexaline, Benzinga Editor May 7, 2023 4:33 PM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsApple's iPhone resurgence during the last quarter was fueled by emerging markets.Although making the iPhone cheaper could be bad for Apple's brand image, it could help rope in consumers into Apple's ecosystem, Gurman saidApple, Inc. AAPL reported last week results for its fiscal year second quarter that beat forecasts. One message that stood out during the company management’s earnings call was an emphasis on ""emerging markets.""What Happened: While Apple CEO Tim Cook's focus on emerging markets wasn't surprising, the number of times the topic was mentioned during the call was higher than expected, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said in his weekly “Power On” newsletter.India alone was mentioned about 20 times on the call, Gurman noted.The iPhone’s resurgence during the quarter was fueled by emerging markets across South Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, Gurman said, citing Apple CFO Luca Maestri.In Apple's more established markets, however, sales fell in the Americas, Japan and China, contributing to an overall revenue decline of about 3%, the columnist said.""The message from Apple is that there's still plenty of room to expand in these newer markets and add customers to its platform,"" Gurman said. He noted that Maestri had mentioned during the call that, in regions where Apple's market share is low, the company tends to add a lot of new customers to its ecosystem.Gurman also pointed out that Cook had said that India is at a ""tipping point,"" where a lot of people  are entering the middle class and could be convinced to buy iPhones. See Also: Everything You Should Know About Apple StockSuper Cheap iPhones Not On Radar: The Apple CEO's comments on India suggests that the company is waiting for Indian consumers to purchase Apple products at standard prices, Gurman said. He added that Apple may not necessarily make super-cheap iPhones in order to penetrate the Indian market.In making his case, Gurman mentioned that two new Apple locations in India are upscale stores, with the same premium-priced products and services seen in other countries.Apple has avoided bringing down the price of its products because it believes that doing so could hurt its brand and profit margins, Gurman said. ""But selling cheaper devices could get more people to buy Apple services, one of the company's few categories that grew last quarter,"" he added.While Apple might not ever release a new iPhone under $300, it could market its older SE models as cheaper alternatives, Gurman said. Apple closed Friday’s session up 4.69% at $173.57, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next: Can Tesla Beat Apple In Market Value?

Benzinga Staff Writer May 7, 2023 2:01 PM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsApple's last major series of layoffs occurred in 1997, when co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company.Last week, Apple reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year. Amid an economic downturn and layoffs across tech industries, Apple Inc AAPL CEO Tim Cook reiterated that mass layoffs are not part of the company's current plans. Speaking with CNBC last week, Cook said that he views mass layoffs as ""a last resort"" and that they are not being discussed. ""We're continuing to hire, just at a lower clip level than we were before. And we're doing all the right things by challenging the things we spend, and we're just finding a few more ways to save on it,"" Cook said. The Apple CEO, however, didn't rule out the possibility of job cuts while noting that the company is ""continuing to be extremely prudent on hiring.""Earlier in February, Cook said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that there are ways to reduce costs without turning to mass layoffs. ""I view layoffs as a last resort kind of thing,"" Cook said. ""You can never say never. We want to manage costs in other ways to the degree we can."" Also Read: Tim Cook Shares The One Thing He's Copied From Steve Jobs As Apple's CEO: 'He Expected It Everywhere In The Company'Apple's last major series of layoffs occurred in 1997, when co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company and Apple, in turn, cut costs by firing 4,100 employees.During the pandemic, the company added employees at a much slower rate than other tech companies. It also ""tends to run lean,"" with limited employee perks and businesses focused on hardware products, The Wall Street Journal reported. Last week, Apple reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year. The company's earnings per share came in at $1.52, beating the consensus estimate of $1.43 per share, while revenue totaled $94.8 billion, compared to analysts' forecast of $92.96 billion.Now Read: Here Is What Apple CEO Tim Cook Plans To Do Before Stepping DownPhoto: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Associated Press Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement SPX +0.64% AAPL MSFT +1.45% INTC +0.15% AMZN +0.47% F +1.71% GM +1.56% DIS +1.05% EA +0.74% RBLX +3.31% U +4.36% APP +1.47% TSN +0.43% WEN +0.21% DNUT -0.54% HOOD +0.96% BYND +4.56% SCHW +0.99% EDR +0.58% BZFD -5.65% NYT +1.15% PYPL +0.15% Most of the first-quarter earnings blizzard has passed, and the overall results haven’t been as bad as expected — thanks in large part to the nation’s biggest tech companies: Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft.   The S&P 500 index SPX has largely moved sideways over the past few weeks, as markets try to stomach concerns about a brittle regional-banking ecosystem and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to navigate the economy through rising prices and past the threat of a recession. But more of the companies that make up that index are turning out stronger-than-normal results. “At this late stage of the Q1 2023 earnings season, S&P 500 companies are recording their best performance relative to analyst expectations since Q4 2021,” FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters said in a report Friday. “Both the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these earnings surprises are above their 10-year averages.” The fourth quarter of 2021 was when markets started to turn sour, and Wall Street’s expectations were subdued heading into the first quarter of this year. Still, with 85% of S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results so far, 79% of those have reported per-share profit topping Wall Street’s expectations. That’s above the 10-year average of 73%.  The results so far represent a 2.2% earnings decline for the quarter, according to the FactSet report. If they hold, they would mark the second straight quarter where per-share profits fell, and the predicted earnings recession. But that 2.2% figure is better than expectations for a 6.7% earnings drop that Wall Street expected for the first quarter at the end of March.  Companies in the Information Technology sector helped lead the charge for those better-than-expected first-quarter results. Butters said that within that sector, results from Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Intel INTC were “substantial contributors” to mitigating that sector’s decline in earnings.  “As a result, the blended earnings decline for the Information Technology sector improved to -10.6% from -15.1% over this period,” Butters said.  Elsewhere, results from Amazon AMZN, Ford Motor Co. F and General Motors Co. GM have buoyed the results of consumer discretionary companies. Butters said that results from those companies helped push the blended earnings growth rate for that segment — or actual results combined with estimated ones for companies that still have to report — to 53.6% from 33.8%. The swings underscore the tech giants’ outsize influence on quarterly earnings and the index overall, as those companies look for firmer footing after the pandemic led to an explosion in digital demand that later faded.  Apple’s results benefited from a surprise gain in iPhone sales, while Microsoft’s bolder-than-anticipated forecast lifted its stock following strong sales gains in its cloud business. Intel still reported a massive loss, but the results overall surpassed estimates. Amazon’s results also beat estimates. However, the stock took a hit after its chief financial officer warned of a slowdown in cloud revenue. This week in earnings For the week ahead, 32 S&P 500 companies will report quarterly results, including one from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Walt Disney Co. DIS. Videogame companies are some of the most prominent this week, with developer Electronic Arts Inc. EA following up layoffs and disappointing results while executives decide whether to delay or pull the plug on some game releases. Also due this week is Roblox Corp. RBLX and monetization engines Unity Software Inc. U and AppLovin Corp. APP. Also on the docket are Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, as customers look for more relief at the grocery store from price increases that helped boost the food industry’s sales and profit. Fast-food chains Wendy’s Co. WEN and Krispy Kreme Inc. DNUT also report, amid some signs that restaurants might back off of similar price increases, but other signs that restaurant prices haven’t eased as much as grocery prices.  Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD and Beyond Meat Inc. BYND also report quarterly results. Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW is also set to report April monthly activity as well. The calls to put on your calendar Lots of media companies, lots of distress: Hollywood writers are on strike for the first time in some 15 years, threatening to grind production to a halt. Digital-media outlets that were once the envy of the industry are reckoning with layoffs and closures after years of aggressive growth. Executive commentary on earnings calls during the week — from the likes of Disney, Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. EDR, BuzzFeed Inc. BZFD and the New York Times Co. NYT — could address what the industry might look like ahead after steep retrenchments.   Those results will arrive as investors shift their focus from growth to profitability after a decade’s worth of chasing news traffic and streaming subscriptions. Following the explosion of digital demand during the pandemic, more questions have also been raised over how much the digital economy values, or devalues, the writers and reporters at its foundation. The results from BuzzFeed and the New York Times will follow the shutdown of BuzzFeed news and the cancellation of “Vice News Tonight,” layoffs at outlets like Vice Media and Insider, and a widening financial divide between the biggest news sites and smaller ones. While shares of BuzzFeed have plunged 88.4% over the past 12 months, New York Times’ shares are up 11.7% over that period.  While it still depends on the craziness of election cycles for subscribers, the New York Times consists of its namesake news outlet, Wirecutter and the Athletic, as well as games and recipes. But even as consumers grow more cautious on spending, JPMorgan analysts recently said they were expecting the company to raise its prices.  “The decision to take price on news we think reflects NYT’s confidence not only in the stand-alone value of its product — even in a period of economic softness — but also in its bundle strategy, as some subscribers may opt for All-Access because of the relative value,” the analysts said in a note in March.  Meanwhile, results from Disney and Endeavor — Hollywood mogul Ari Emanuel’s entertainment conglomerate — could yield more detail on how both companies are navigating a potentially larger work stoppage, after the union representing TV and film writers went on strike following an impasse with studios over pay and protections for streaming and concerns about being replaced with AI. Disney CEO Robert Iger will have even more issues to discuss, including dueling lawsuits with the state of Florida and layoffs that have been rippling through the media giant.The number to watch PayPal and consumer spending: Payments platform PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL reports quarterly results on Monday, ahead of leadership changes at the top and in-limbo online spending. The results will be a proxy for consumer spending overall, after e-commerce demand surged and then faded through the pandemic.  Earnings Outlook: PayPal seems on track to ‘clear a low bar.’ Is that enough to help its stock? PayPal could also face more questions about its future during its earnings call, after Chief Executive Dan Schulman in February said he planned to retire from the company at the end of the year. BofA analysts, in a research note last month, said further detail on Schulman’s successor in the months ahead would be a key focal point, after the stock, a steady gainer for years, shed a good chunk of those increases in 2021. The analysts added that “we continue to believe that tech product development / deployment needs to be a core skill set of the new leader.” This article has been updated to clarify that Charles Schwab is set to report monthly activity this week.

Got it!Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinWennie Wen of New York City poses for photos in the exhibition hall of the Berkshire Hathaway annual ... [+] meeting on Saturday, May 6, 2023, in Omaha, Neb. (AP Photo/Rebecca S. Gratz)Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) annual “Woodstock for Capitalists” was held on May 6th. After last year’s attendance was below recent years, it was a packed house on Saturday. Warren Buffett, CEO and Chairman, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman, answered questions from shareholders for over five hours. Greg Abel and Ajit Jain joined in answering questions for the first part of the meeting. After the traditional movie to open the meeting, featuring Jaime Lee Curtis this year, Buffett briefly reviewed first-quarter earnings. He provided the closest thing to earnings guidance that he has ever uttered. Buffett noted that it is a “different climate than it was six months ago,” so the majority of Berkshire’s businesses are likely to have lower earnings in 2023 than the previous year. The good news is that higher yields should lead to higher investment income in 2023, and insurance underwriting does not “correlate with economic activity.” In other words, the insurance businesses should do better than in 2022. With the tailwind from the insurance segment, Buffett expects Berkshire’s 2023 operating earnings to be better than last year. As one would expect, given the recent banking failures, the pair was asked multiple questions about the U.S. banking system. Buffett summarized the challenge of a bank crisis by saying that “fear is contagious, always.” In a rare move, he directly criticized some of the banking practices of the failed First Republic Bank (FRC). Buffett mentioned that First Republic offered non-government guaranteed jumbo mortgages, and the “world ignored it until it blew up.” While he gave his opinion that the depositors at U.S. banks are safe even beyond the FDIC guarantee, he wouldn’t commit to how regional bank shareholders would fare. Munger summarized the situation in his classic style, adding that “a bunch of bankers trying to get rich doesn’t lead to good things.” Buffett took the opportunity to contrast banking with Berkshire’s insurance business. The insurance business produces float, created by the premiums paid by those purchasing insurance. The insurance company gets to invest the float until the insurance claims are made. In addition, unlike bank deposits, the float can’t be withdrawn and doesn’t earn any interest. Buffett said, “It’s like having a bank with no employees, no interest, and no ability to withdraw the money in a hurry.” Berkshire’s float is now approximately $165 billion, an increase of roughly $1 billion year-to-date. Buffett did say that “banks can be a perfectly good investment.” He noted that in addition to owning banks in Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio, Berkshire had a wholly-owned bank at one time with plans to acquire more before legislation forced them to sell it. Buffett typically refrains from giving much detail about Berkshire’s publicly traded stock holdings but spoke about Occidental Petroleum (OXY). According to Bloomberg, Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with a 23.6% stake. Buffett said he doesn’t know what the price of oil will be, but he likes Occidental Petroleum’s position in the Permian basin and management. He left the door open that Berkshire could purchase more shares but said it would stop short of making an offer to control the company. Here are more details about the possible reasons for Berkshire’s investment in Occidental Petroleum. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor When asked about the possibility of future dividends, Buffett noted that Berkshire paid a dividend once, which was a mistake. He said Berkshire could distribute cash in a significant way via stock buybacks if the stock became undervalued. In addition, he would prefer to have the money on hand to make substantial acquisitions if any attractive targets became available. For those worried about the stock dropping precipitously when Buffett and Munger can no longer manage the firm, Buffett’s statement that Berkshire “will buy $50 billion of our stock if it makes sense” should provide some comfort. Share repurchases accelerated in the first quarter, as Berkshire bought back $4.4 billion of stock. When asked about the prudence of Apple (AAPL), comprising over 35% of Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio, Buffett noted that Apple was not 35% of Berkshire’s portfolio because the firm has many wholly owned subsidiaries. He added that a previous sale of Apple shares was done partially for tax reasons but was “still a mistake.” He went on to say that Apple was a “better business than any we own.” Munger chimed in on the subject with a more direct response that we “ignore most notions of our experts about de-worsification of portfolios.” Here is more analysis of Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio. Lastly, when answering a question about the opportunities for value investing in an era of disruptive technology, Munger argues that value investors will have a more challenging time now that so many intelligent people are competing for the same opportunities. Buffett was more optimistic that there would be “plenty of opportunities.” He believes technology has continuously changed, but human nature remains the same. Buffett said that opportunities come from “other people doing dumb things,” and they will continue to do more dumb things in the future.

Despite its advantages, Wall Street's obsession with short-term performance is arguably its biggest weakness. There are plenty of opportunities for individual value investors in today's market.

Learn More Buffett and Munger share words of caution and optimism at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. Warren Buffett got his start by investing in small, unknown companies for less than they were worth. A lot has changed in the decades since, and Buffett has repeatedly said that many of those easy opportunities have long been lost due to a far more sophisticated and informed market. During Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A -0.36%) (BRK.B -0.50%) annual shareholders meeting on Saturday, Buffett's right-hand man, Charlie Munger, had a warning to investors. ""I think value investors are going to have a harder time now that there's so many of them competing for a diminished bunch of opportunities. So my advice to value investors is to get used to making less,"" Munger said. But before you despair, consider this piece of good news: Buffett believes that short-term thinking and dumb ideas are running more rampant than ever. Investors who combat these impulses with patience can gain an edge over Wall Street. Here's what Munger and Buffett said about value investing at the annual meeting -- and how their lessons could help you make wise investment decisions. Image source: The Motley Fool. Opportunities occur when people do dumb things Because Berkshire is so big now, Buffett and Munger can't benefit much from investing in traditional hidden gems. Instead, they have to focus more on finding high-quality companies and letting those investments compound over time. Yet value investors around the world still look up to them for their ability to identify what Buffett would call ""a wonderful business at a fair price."" Today's media landscape has more voices preaching fast and easy money. There are plenty of dangerous yet enviable success stories built on a house of lucky cards. Buffett believes that part of the problem is that it is easier for people to get the capital needed to pitch an idea or pursue a bad business plan. When these businesses go public, their financials or path to profitability can be cloudy at best. This presents a challenge for investors that have to filter out the noise and determine if a prospective growth stock can bridge the gap between expectations and reality. On Saturday, Buffett said: New things coming along don't take away the opportunities. What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things. And I would say that the 58 years we've been running Berkshire, I would say there's been a great increase in the number of people doing dumb things, and they do big dumb things. And the reason they do it to some extent is because they can get money from other people so much easier than when we started. Buffett believes he could do well if he were just starting out in today's market by simply ignoring Wall Street's short-term focus and identifying opportunities based on long-term fundamentals: The world is overwhelmingly short-term focused. And if you go to an investor relations call ... the management is interested in feeding them expectations that will slightly be beaten. That is a world that is made to order for anybody that's trying to think about what to do that should work over five, or ten, or twenty years. And I just think that I'd love to be born today, and go out with not too much money and hopefully turn it into a lot of money. When Buffett was first starting out, the greatest advantage a value investor could have was access to information. Today, with information beyond the young Buffett's dreams available without much effort, the greatest advantage is the ability to ignore distractions and the discipline to maintain a long-term time horizon. Focusing on what matters most Buffett's disdain for speculative gambles and big companies taking advantage of smaller players has been an ongoing narrative for several years. However, Buffett did provide a reassuring comment for investors that are managing less capital -- such as individual investors. I think that investing has disappeared so much from this huge capitalistic market, that anybody can play in, but the big money is in selling other people ideas that aren't outperforming. And I think that if you don't if you don't run too much money, which we do, but if you're running small amounts of money, I think the opportunities will be greater. But then Charlie and I have always differed on this subject, he likes to tell me how gloomy the world is and I like to tell him, ""We'll find something,"" and so far we've both been kind of right. One of the biggest advantages of being an individual investor is that your results aren't measured against peers. All that matters is that you achieve your financial goals. Financial goals and aligning your personal risk tolerance with your investment allocation matter much more than beating the market in a given year or two. Taking advantage of Wall Street's short-term focus Despite Buffett's steadfast optimism toward the individual value investor, both Buffett and Munger agreed that investing is far harder today than when they first got their start. Munger said the following during the annual meeting: There is so much money in the hands of so many smart people, all trying to outsmart one another, and outgrow one another, getting more money out of other people. And it's a radically different world from the world we started in, and I suppose it will have its opportunities, but it's also going to have some unpleasant episodes. In the pursuit of outsmarting each other, Wall Street can often drastically overvalue or undervalue a stock in the short term -- which can lead to generational wealth for long-term investors. Berkshire has a history of taking advantage of mispriced assets, whether it's swooping in to invest in distressed financial institutions or its relatively recent success with Apple. Buffet and his team began buying Apple stock during a time when its price to earnings ratio was around 12 and Wall Street was skeptical its ability to scale with services revenue. Fast forward to Apple's latest quarter, and it's notched a staggering $20.9 billion just in services revenue -- an all-time high for the segment. A vote of confidence for individual investors It's easy to get discouraged by Wall Street's influence and the growing sophistication of public markets. But if the past few years have taught us anything, it's that markets are more sensitive than ever to short-term performance. It can feel like a lot to handle: the wild price swings of 2020, the tech boom of 2021, the steep sell-off of 2022, and the gradual recovery of 2023. But zoom out, and the volatility for high-quality companies was ultimately just noise. So while the competition on Wall Street may be more intense than ever before, there's a good argument that individual value investors can still do quite well in the stock market so long as they stay principled and patient.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These stocks have competitive advantages that can drive their long-term success. Warren Buffett is a name that's synonymous with investing success. Through his company, Berkshire Hathaway, he's managed to amass a fortune in the stock market rivaled by very few in history. Many Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have also gotten rich along the way. Buffett's investing philosophy has remained simple yet is tried and true: Invest in great businesses and hold them for the long haul. If you're looking for Buffett stocks to invest in right now, look no further than these three no-brainers. 1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (KO -0.43%) is up the fourth-largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, trailing behind only Apple, Bank of America, and Chevron. Buffett likes Coca-Cola because it's a stock he feels comfortable holding forever, primarily because of the company's iconic brand and unrivaled distribution. Impressively, Coca-Cola has managed to get distribution in more than 200 countries and territories around the world, which isn't easy to do -- especially profitably. In the first quarter of this year, the company increased its organic revenue (revenue from its core business operations) by 12% year over year. That's a decline from its Q4 2022 year-over-year growth, but it still beat earnings-per-share predictions by 5.4%. The company continues to add to its portfolio by investing in beverage categories outside of soft drinks. Coca-Cola's water and coffee segments unit case volume increased by 5% and 9%, respectively, outpacing its flagship Coca-Cola soda and other sparking soft drinks. There's no doubt soft drinks are Coca-Cola's main money-maker, but its long-term growth will likely depend on how well it can compete in high-growth categories such as ready-to-drink alcohol. The good news is Coca-Cola's management has shown its willingness to make the necessary investments to maintain its dominance and expand its offerings. You could argue that Coca-Cola is slightly overvalued, but if you're in it for the long term, you shouldn't be too concerned, given the company's track record. Add in the company's generous dividend, and you can be like Buffett and feel comfortable holding this stock forever. 2. Snowflake Snowflake (SNOW 0.73%) was a rare investment in an initial public offering (IPO) for Berkshire Hathaway, which purchased about $735 million worth of shares of the company at its $120 IPO price in September 2020. Snowflake's stock is now just over $155, which isn't a loss for Berkshire Hathaway, but it's also a far cry from its November 2021 high of about $392. Snowflake is a cloud data-warehousing platform that seems to have all the tools needed to be an industry leader for a long time. Buffett once said, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes,"" and Snowflake should be a stock investors feel comfortable holding for a decade-plus. As of March 1, the company had just over 7,800 customers (up 31% year over year), with 330 spending at least $1 million annually with the company (up 79% year over year). And one way to know it's not just hype is Snowflake's 158% dollar-based net revenue retention rate. This means customers are spending 58% more each year with the company -- a key to longevity. Snowflake hasn't reached net profitability yet, but its free cash flow is impressive. In its 2022 investor day presentation, the company said it wanted to achieve 25% free-cash-flow margins (free cash flow as a percentage of revenue) by its 2029 fiscal year. It managed to hit 25% this past fiscal year, so the company is headed in the right direction. 3. Visa It's been a good few years for Visa (V 1.17%), which has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Visa has one of Buffett's favorite qualities in a company: a huge competitive moat. In Visa's case, its competitive moat is its merchant reach. As of the fiscal second-quarter ended March 31, Visa had more than 100 million merchants in its global network. Because Visa earns money by taking a percentage of the transactions it processes, it could take a slight hit if a recession occurs and causes people and businesses to slow spending. In the meantime, the company's been going strong. In fiscal Q2, Visa brought in $7.9 billion in revenue (up 11% year over year) and increased payments volume by 10%. Despite its impressive reach, there's still plenty of room for Visa to grow, considering how many countries still operate predominantly with cash. The gap it has on competitors will be all but impossible to close anytime soon -- especially if Visa continues growing at the current rate.

REUTERS/Rachel MummeyOMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) posted a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit on Saturday, reflecting gains from stocks such as Apple Inc, while higher investment income and a rebound at car insurer Geico bolstered operating results.Berkshire also sped up repurchases of its own stock, buying back $4.4 billion, while paring its investments in other stocks such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which is still a major holding.Results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and manufacturing and retail units including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.MORE CASHNet income equaled $24,377 per Class A share and rose from $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share, a year earlier.That in part reflected a 27% jump in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock price, leaving Berkshire with a $151 billion stake in the iPhone maker.An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.Quarterly operating profit increased 13% to $8.07 billion, or about $5,561 per Class A share, from $7.16 billion.Those results benefited from Geico snapping a six-quarter string of underwriting losses, and a 68% increase in how much Berkshire's insurance units generate from investments.Geico's pretax underwriting gain was $703 million, benefiting from higher premiums, fewer crashes and a significant drop in ad spending, which may have led to fewer high-risk drivers seeking coverage.Berkshire's cash hoard grew $2 billion in the quarter to $130.6 billion, as the company sold $13.3 billion of stocks and bought just $2.9 billion.Chevron appears to have been among the sales, with Berkshire's stake falling 28% to $21.6 billion though the oil company's stock price dropped just 9%.Berkshire also owns a 23.6% stake in another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N).Its stock sales more than offset the $8.2 billion Berkshire spent to boost its stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers to 80% from 38.6%, leaving the founding Haslam family with 20%. The increase was expected.IMPACT OF WILDFIRESProfit at the BNSF railroad fell 9% to $1.25 billion, hurt by higher fuel costs and lower shipping volumes.Berkshire Hathaway Energy, normally a steady earnings generator, saw profit fall 46% as it set aside $359 million for legal and other costs from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has multiple operations, in 2020.Operating results also reflected October's purchase of insurance holding company Alleghany Corp, while net results included a gain related to Pilot.Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 4.9% this year, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500's (.SPX) 7.7% gain. The index lagged Berkshire by 23.4 percentage points in 2022, excluding dividends.Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Nextarticle with videoChargedcategoryToyota unveils sweeping plans for new battery tech, EV innovation12:12 PM UTCAutos & TransportationcategoryAnalysis: GM could reap billions by building combustion trucks and SUVs through 203512:26 PM UTCarticle with galleryWorld at WorkcategoryAnalysis: Tesla taps brakes on job ads after Musk clamps down on hiring10:10 AM UTCMedia & TelecomcategoryFox sends Tucker Carlson cease-and-desist letter - AxiosJune 12, 2023More from ReutersBusinessGermany plans purchase of six IRIS-T air defence units - sourceAerospace & Defensecategory · June 13, 2023 · 8:31 AM UTCGermany aims to purchase six IRIS-T air defence systems for its air force at a total cost of some 900 million euros ($971.73 million), a defence source told Reuters ahead of a final decision by lawmakers on Wednesday.Aerospace & DefensecategoryIsrael reports record $12.5 bln defence exports, 24% of them to Arab partners12:32 PM UTCChargedcategoryAnalysis: EV charger makers guardedly look to adopt Tesla standardJune 12, 2023FinancecategoryHSBC to close New Zealand wealth and personal banking business8:50 AM UTCAerospace & DefensecategoryUnited Air CEO sees pilot deal adding over $8 bln in costs - Bloomberg News11:27 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Benzinga Editor May 6, 2023 6:11 PM |  1 min read Zinger Key PointsApple continues to impress at time when its peers are struggling with consumer demand.The recent banking crisis, along with other factors, should give investors some pause on regional bank stocks, according to one analyst. Benzinga reviews this weekend's top stories covered by Barron's. Here are the articles investors need to read. In ""Apple Defies the Trend. Why There's Still Time to Buy the Stock,"" Tae Kim explains why Apple Inc AAPL ""deserves a premium,"" even though the technology sector has experienced a roller-coaster ride and the overall demand for computers and smartphones has fallen. ""Envestnet Earnings Beat Estimates. The Stock is Falling"" by Andrew Welsch explores why technology and services provider Envestnet Inc ENV is still struggling to entice investors after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street estimates.

Editor May 6, 2023 1:59 PM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsApple reported strong second-quarter results on better-than-expected iPhone sales and robust Services revenue.Over next 5 years, investors will increasingly see Apple as a can’t live without consumer staples company, Munster says.Apple, Inc. AAPL reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Thursday, helping to lift the market on Friday after four consecutive sessions of losses.What Happened: Following the news, Jim Cramer tweeted on Friday, ""Apple: Own it Don't Trade it.""  He also revealed that his patience with the company worked this past week, according to CNBC. The “Mad Money” host previously flagged four main challenges for the market this week, including Wednesday's Fed meeting, Friday's job report, the debt ceiling and Apple earnings.""I refuse to be shaken out of the world's best company by one errant component supplier or a couple of joker-brokers who say, ‘Hey, things have gotten weaker,'"" Cramer said in reference to the setback Apple experienced late last year when its main iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Manufacturing Company Limited HNHPF, otherwise known as Foxconn, faced production disruption at its main iPhone factory. ""It was a classic misdirection play, and I hope you didn't fall for it,"" Cramer added. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple StockWhy It's Important: Twitter users had a field day with Cramer’s tweet on Friday. Given the television personality and former hedge fund manager’s history of making bets that eventually go awry, one user shared a meme of a person with a hopeless expression and a caption saying, ""Your entire life savings is in Apple and Jim just said to own it.""Notwithstanding the public criticism Cramer has received for his takes, Apple is considered a solid investment bet and fairly recession-resistant. In a note on Thursday, Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster wrote, ""Over the next five years, I expect investors will increasingly see Apple as a can't live without consumer staples company.""Read Next: Apple Earnings Call Takeaways: Emerging Market Strength, Guarded AI Approach, Muted Q3 Guidance And MorePhoto: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

REUTERS/Rachel MummeyOMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday criticized the handling of recent tumult in the banking sector and said a debt ceiling showdown could bring ""turmoil"" to the financial system, even as he offered a vote of confidence in the United States and his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).Speaking at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett criticized how politicians, regulators and the press have handled the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, saying their ""very poor"" messaging has unnecessarily frightened depositors.""Fear is contagious,"" he said, adding that ""you can't run an economy"" when people worry if their money is safe in banks.Buffett also warned of a growing ""tribalism"" in Washington where partisanship causes people to talk past each other.""We have to refine, in a certain way, our democracy as we go along. But if I still had a choice, I would want to be born in the United States. It is a better world than we've ever had.""Buffett spoke hours after Berkshire posted a $35.5 billion quarterly profit and said it bought back $4.4 billion of its own stock, a sign it considered the shares undervalued.In contrast, it sold $13.3 billion of other companies' stocks, in a quarter where the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) rose 7%.The world's sixth-richest person, Buffett has since 1965 run Berkshire, whose dozens of businesses include Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and consumer names such as Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom.Berkshire also owns $328 billion of stocks, close to half in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).The meeting featured Buffett, 92, who is Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 99, answering five hours of shareholder questions. Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, 60, and Ajit Jain, 71, joined in the morning.Buffett reiterated on Saturday that Abel would succeed him as CEO, while adding he had no plan if Abel could not.LIGHTED MATCHBuffett said regulators were right to guarantee depositors of Silicon Valley Bank, saying that not doing so ""would have been catastrophic.""He also said bank shareholders and executives should bear the risks of mismanagement, with Munger criticizing executives concerned more with getting rich than with customers.""A lighted match can be turned into a conflagration or can be blown out,"" Buffett said. ""You have to have punishment for people who do the wrong thing.""Buffett also said he could not imagine politicians or regulators being willing to ""disrupt the world's financial system,"" including if Washington failed to break its impasse on raising the debt ceiling, or how much the government could borrow.Anticipating questions on banking, Buffett prompted laughter by putting in front of him a sign reading ""AVAILABLE FOR SALE"" and one reading ""HELD-TO-MATURITY"" before Munger.These referred to how lenders account for their securities, a central issue in the recent banking crisis.Buffett said Berkshire is cautious about banks and sold some bank stocks in the past six months.Saturday's meeting is the centerpiece of a weekend Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" that draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, Nebraska, its hometown.Attendance surged from 2022. Unlike last year the downtown arena hosting the meeting was filled to capacity.BUFFETT: ""APPLE IS A BETTER BUSINESS""In discussing Berkshire's performance, Buffett said perhaps a majority of its operating businesses may fare worse in 2023 than in 2022 as economic activity slows.But he said Berkshire can offset this with more income from investments, including $7 billion of Treasury bills bought in April.Buffett defended the size of Berkshire's $151 billion Apple investment, saying consumers are less likely to shed their $1,500 iPhones than, for example, their $35,000 second cars.""Apple is different than the other businesses we own,"" Buffett said. ""It just happens to be a better business.""Berkshire has recently held a 5.6% stake in Apple, and Buffett said it could buy more.""Portfolio management practices would suggested there is definitely concentration risk with having so much Apple in that portfolio,"" said Cathy Seifert, vice-president at CFRA Research.He also said that while Berkshire owns nearly one-fourth of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), it has no plans to take control of the company.Munger, a longtime China bull who spearheaded Berkshire's investment in electric car company BYD Co , called for lowered tensions and increased trade between that country and the United States.Buffett cited those tensions in saying he is more comfortable deploying capital in Japan than in Taiwan.WAITING ON LINEPrior to the meeting, dozens of uniform-clad pilots at Berkshire-owned NetJets demonstrated outside the arena, protesting low pay and long hours.Thousands of shareholders, meanwhile, lined up outside the arena before it opened at 7 a.m. CDT (1200 GMT). Many recognized it could be one of their last chances to see Buffett and Munger, given their ages.Vidhya Vivekananda, an investment associate from Vancouver, Canada, said she and her husband showed up 30 minutes earlier for their first meeting.""It has been on our bucket list for a long time,"" she said. ""We don't know how long it will be with Warren and Charlie before they pass it on.""Yongsheng Zhao, who lives in Shanghai and is a researcher for an asset management firm, said he showed up at midnight with a chair to see Buffett and Munger for the eighth time.""I am inspired by their passion and normalcy,"" he said. ""I would hope they can go another five years, or more.""Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; additional reporting by Carolina Mandl and John McCrank in New York; Editing by Megan Davies, Ira Iosebashvili and Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Nextarticle with videoChargedcategoryToyota unveils sweeping plans for new battery tech, EV innovation12:12 PM UTCAutos & TransportationcategoryAnalysis: GM could reap billions by building combustion trucks and SUVs through 203512:26 PM UTCarticle with galleryWorld at WorkcategoryAnalysis: Tesla taps brakes on job ads after Musk clamps down on hiring10:10 AM UTCMedia & TelecomcategoryFox sends Tucker Carlson cease-and-desist letter - AxiosJune 12, 2023More from ReutersBusinessGermany plans purchase of six IRIS-T air defence units - sourceAerospace & Defensecategory · June 13, 2023 · 8:31 AM UTCGermany aims to purchase six IRIS-T air defence systems for its air force at a total cost of some 900 million euros ($971.73 million), a defence source told Reuters ahead of a final decision by lawmakers on Wednesday.Aerospace & DefensecategoryIsrael reports record $12.5 bln defence exports, 24% of them to Arab partners12:32 PM UTCChargedcategoryAnalysis: EV charger makers guardedly look to adopt Tesla standardJune 12, 2023FinancecategoryHSBC to close New Zealand wealth and personal banking business8:50 AM UTCAerospace & DefensecategoryUnited Air CEO sees pilot deal adding over $8 bln in costs - Bloomberg News11:27 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research 3 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy in May By John Ballard, Jeremy Bowman, and Jennifer Saibil – May 6, 2023 at 8:39AM Key Points Apple has an incredibly strong brand that made it one of the most profitable companies in the world. MercadoLibre is putting blockbuster growth in a wide-open market. Airbnb can generate years of growth through its adaptive platform.

Learn More These companies dominate the field in their respective industries. While no stock is immune from market swings, investors don't have to worry about short-term dips. Stocks ultimately follow the growth (or lack thereof) of the underlying business. What makes a company unstoppable is its ability to deliver sustainable growth in revenue and profits over the long term. That's what creates lasting wealth for shareholders. Apple (AAPL 1.56%), MercadoLibre (MELI 2.45%), and Airbnb (ABNB 5.71%) are all showing signs of real staying power, which could lead to many years of magnificent returns. Let's see why these Motley Fool contributors believe these companies are unstoppable. Invest in the products people can't live without John Ballard (Apple): When trying to identify a company that could be unstoppable, you want to think of powerful brands that millions of people rely on every day. On that criteria alone, it's hard to not to like Apple, whose flagship product, the iPhone, is an indispensable device for many. While sales could soften during a severe economic downturn, investors shouldn't be concerned about that, because Apple has a very loyal customer base. This is noted by its consistently high customer satisfaction scores and its growing installed base of active devices, now over 2 billion. Plus, the company introduced several new services in recent years that are driving consistent year-round revenue, like Apple TV+, Apple Card, Apple Pay, and more. Apple will continue to drive repeat upgrades as it invests in artificial intelligence to make its products even better. This will create a stickier attachment between customers and their devices. Investors can't go wrong investing in strong brands that generate massive cash flows. Over the last four quarters, Apple generated a whopping $97 billion in free cash flow on $387 billion of revenue. It's got more cash than it knows what to do with, which is why management continues to plow funds into share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments. It's for these reasons Apple is an unstoppable stock to consider buying this month. An e-commerce superstar Jeremy Bowman (MercadoLibre): If you're looking for unstoppable stocks to buy this month, look no further than MercadoLibre, the Latin American e-commerce company that has been a top performer on the stock market over its history. MercadoLibre just offered a reminder of why the stock is still a top buy in its first-quarter earnings report. Currency-neutral revenue in the quarter jumped 58% to $3 billion with total payment volume nearly doubling, up 96% to $37 billion. Gross merchandise volume, meanwhile, also surged 43% to $9.4 billion. MercadoLibre's strength across e-commerce and digital payments makes it unique, and the company has also built formidable businesses in logistics with Mercado Envios and lending with Mercado Credito. Unlike its U.S-based e-commerce counterparts, MercadoLibre has continued to put up strong growth over the last year even as the pandemic tailwinds slowed, a sign the company continues to gain market share and is penetrating a large market that is still behind the U.S. in e-commerce adoption. MercadoLibre's profitability also ramped up as it gained scale in e-commerce and payments. Operating margin in the first quarter jumped from 6.2% in the quarter a year ago to 11.2%, giving it an operating income of $340 million. As the company builds scale with its first-party e-commerce business and digital payments investments, it's been able to layer on higher-margin businesses like its third-party marketplace, its credits business, and advertising, following in the footsteps of Amazon. The company doesn't provide guidance, but its growth momentum looks as strong as ever, and the company should continue to gain market share as it penetrates the massive Latin American market. It's about time for travel to be disrupted Jennifer Saibil (Airbnb): It's not surprising that the travel industry has been upended. For decades it was dominated by large hotel chains, whether of the luxury or budget variety, with a sprinkling of vacation rentals abounding once the internet made them more accessible. Airbnb took that concept to new heights, and its platform, which matches renters and hosts, ballooned into the premier travel site of its kind. Growth is robust but is easing a bit. Triple-digit sales growth that marked a rebound from the pandemic has decelerated to double digits. Revenue rose 24% year over year in the 2022 fourth quarter to $1.9 billion. But the growth runway is very long. Airbnb offers an agile system that can adapt to changing consumer needs and trends, as opposed to legacy hotel companies that take tons of time and money to get new buildings up. Travelers are using the platform to vacation in a different way, such as living in new areas. That's both as a vacation, where renters are exploring out-of-the-way areas that the big chains aren't accessing, and full-time living. Rentals of 28 days or more continue to be an important segment, remaining at 21% of bookings in the fourth quarter. Airbnb has also become sustainably profitable. It posted net income for the past three consecutive quarters as well as an annual profit in 2022. It's also awash in cash, ending the year with $3.4 billion in free cash flow. Airbnb made a bold move when it went public at the end of 2020 amid heavy sales declines. But investors scooped it up regardless, partially due to its incredible market opportunity, and partially due to the general initial public offering craze and robust bull market that was taking place at that time. The price skyrocketed, and it's now down 44% since its highs in 2021. At this price, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 43. That's not incredibly cheap, but it's down to a more reasonable level. With Airbnb's opportunities, investors could consider that valuation low enough to purchase shares.

REUTERS/Scott MorganOMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N posted a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit on Saturday, reflecting gains from stocks such as Apple Inc, while higher investment income and a rebound at car insurer Geico bolstered operating results.Berkshire also sped up repurchases of its own stock, buying back $4.4 billion, while paring its investments in other stocks such as Chevron Corp CVX.N, which is still a major holding.Results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and manufacturing and retail units including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.MORE CASHNet income equaled $24,377 per Class A share and rose from $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share, a year earlier.That in part reflected a 27% jump in Apple's AAPL.O stock price, leaving Berkshire with a $151 billion stake in the iPhone maker.An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.Quarterly operating profit increased 13% to $8.07 billion, or about $5,561 per Class A share, from $7.16 billion.Those results benefited from Geico snapping a six-quarter string of underwriting losses, and a 68% increase in how much Berkshire's insurance units generate from investments.Geico's pretax underwriting gain was $703 million, benefiting from higher premiums, fewer crashes and a significant drop in ad spending, which may have led to fewer high-risk drivers seeking coverage.Berkshire's cash hoard grew $2 billion in the quarter to $130.6 billion, as the company sold $13.3 billion of stocks and bought just $2.9 billion.Chevron appears to have been among the sales, with Berkshire's stake falling 28% to $21.6 billion though the oil company's stock price dropped just 9%.Berkshire also owns a 23.6% stake in another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N.Its stock sales more than offset the $8.2 billion Berkshire spent to boost its stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers to 80% from 38.6%, leaving the founding Haslam family with 20%. The increase was expected.IMPACT OF WILDFIRESProfit at the BNSF railroad fell 9% to $1.25 billion, hurt by higher fuel costs and lower shipping volumes.Berkshire Hathaway Energy, normally a steady earnings generator, saw profit fall 46% as it set aside $359 million for legal and other costs from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has multiple operations, in 2020.Operating results also reflected October's purchase of insurance holding company Alleghany Corp, while net results included a gain related to Pilot.Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 4.9% this year, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500's .SPX 7.7% gain. The index lagged Berkshire by 23.4 percentage points in 2022, excluding dividends.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander Smith and Diane Craft)Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Nextarticle with videoChargedcategoryToyota unveils sweeping plans for new battery tech, EV innovation12:12 PM UTCAutos & TransportationcategoryAnalysis: GM could reap billions by building combustion trucks and SUVs through 203512:26 PM UTCarticle with galleryWorld at WorkcategoryAnalysis: Tesla taps brakes on job ads after Musk clamps down on hiring10:10 AM UTCMedia & TelecomcategoryFox sends Tucker Carlson cease-and-desist letter - AxiosJune 12, 2023More from ReutersBusinessGermany plans purchase of six IRIS-T air defence units - sourceAerospace & Defensecategory · June 13, 2023 · 8:31 AM UTCGermany aims to purchase six IRIS-T air defence systems for its air force at a total cost of some 900 million euros ($971.73 million), a defence source told Reuters ahead of a final decision by lawmakers on Wednesday.Aerospace & DefensecategoryIsrael reports record $12.5 bln defence exports, 24% of them to Arab partners12:32 PM UTCChargedcategoryAnalysis: EV charger makers guardedly look to adopt Tesla standardJune 12, 2023FinancecategoryHSBC to close New Zealand wealth and personal banking business8:50 AM UTCAerospace & DefensecategoryUnited Air CEO sees pilot deal adding over $8 bln in costs - Bloomberg News11:27 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

View All Top Stories Profit From the Best AND Worst Stocks! SPY – Stock markets suffered through a rough year in 2022. Major indices like the S&P 500 (SPY) and NASDAQ 100 were down double digits across the board. Yet this simple strategy showed a solid double-digit gain by taking profitable positions in both good AND bad stocks. This type of balanced approach will likely continue to outperform in what looks like to be a tough second half of 2023. Read on below to find out more… By Tim Biggam May 6, 2023 2022 was one of the worst years for stocks in a long time. After a strong start to 2023, stocks are failing to break out at recent highs. What happens the rest of the year remains to be seen. The recent rise in interest rates along with a continued earnings recession is likely to be an overhang that will continue to stall stocks for the final two quarters of 2023. The average annual return for stocks (S&P 500) over the past 150 years is roughly 9%, including dividends. Without dividends it drops to just over 4.5%. Inflation shaves about half off those returns. A return back towards more historic returns may look pretty good in the coming 12 months. Stock selection will be critical to performing well in 2023, rather than just buying any stock -which was seemingly the way to easy gains up until 2022. The POWR Ratings can certainly provide investors and traders with a clear edge when selecting stocks. Over the past 20 plus years, the A Rated strong buys in the POWR Ratings have outperformed the S&P 500 by over 22% annually. While this level of outperformance is truly eye-opening, selling the F rated strong sell stocks would have beaten the overall market by an even greater degree. These lowest rated stocks actually fell over 21% per year while the S&P 500 gained nearly 7% annually. This equates to an underperformance of roughly 28%! This means the bad stocks fell a bit worse than the good stocks rose in comparison to the S&P 500. Many investors and traders are not comfortable shorting stocks. Unlimited potential loss increases the fear factor even more. Luckily, the options market provides a defined risk solution to profit from a pullback in stocks. Puts. Owning a put option gives you the ability to sell a stock at a specific price before a certain time. The put buyer pays money upfront – called the option premium. For instance, buying the Apple July $155 put at $4.30 gives the buyer the right to sell AAPL stock at $155 until expiration on 7/21/2023 (the third Friday in July). The price of these bearish put options will increase as the stock goes down and decrease if the stock rises. The most at risk is $430 ($4.30 premium x 100) Buying put options is a simple, but very effective way, to take a bearish stance on bad stocks (using Apple as an example, not that is a bad stock). To help offset this bearish view, POWR Options combines it with a bullish trade that is done with a call purchase. Owning a call option gives you the ability to buy a stock at a specific price before a certain time. The call buyer again pays money upfront – called the option premium. For instance, buying the Apple July $175 call at $4.50 gives the buyer the right to buy AAPL stock at $175 until expiration on 7/21/2023 (the third Friday in July). The price of these bullish call options will increase as the stock goes up and decrease if the stock drops. The most at risk is $450 ($4.50 premium x 100). But instead of just combining puts and calls on the same stock, POWR options uses the power of the POWR Ratings to combine puts on the lowest rated (D and F) names along with bullish calls on the highest rated (A and B) stocks. Sell the worst and buy the best-but define the risk. Pairing a bearish put and bullish call together is called a “Pairs Trade”. These two trades together combine for a much more neutral outlook. It is a strategy we successfully use day in and day out in the POWR Options Portfolio to take a more balanced “Pairs Trade” approach by combining bearish puts with bullish calls. It worked very well in 2022 and continues to work very well so far in 2023. A recent example of this POWR Pairs approach using the power of the POWR ratings for bearish put plays and bullish call plays may help shed some light on things. Below is a recent POWR Pairs trade done in the POWR Options Portfolio on Acuity Brands (AYI) and Roblox (RBLX). AYI was an A rated- Strong Buy -stock in a C rated Industry. Number one in the industry. Strong stock in a strong position. RBLX was an F rated -Strong Sell – stock in a D rated industry. Ranked at the bottom in the industry group as well, so pretty much the worst of the worst. Yet over the past few weeks, much lower rated Roblox had been outperforming much higher rated Acuity by a wide margin. In fact, since the beginning of the year A rated AYI was lower by almost 5% while F rated RBLX screamed much higher-up 60%!. This set up ideally for a POWR Pairs trade. Buying bullish calls on the big-time underperforming Strong Buy AYI and bearish puts on the hugely outperforming Strong Sell RBLX. The expectation was for the spread between the two to converge back towards a more normal comparative performance with AYI outperforming RBLX. That proved to be the case. RBLX dropped sharply while AYI traded sideways. The spread converged from over 60% at trade inception (red) to 25% at close out (green). POWR Options closed out the POWR Pairs trade for a $210 overall gain. $40 loss on the AYI calls and a $250 gain on the RBLX puts.  Trade took 16 days from start to finish. Over a 20% gain on the $970 invested in both the AYI calls ($500) and RBLX puts ($470). Not bad for a few weeks work on a neutral trade. This table below shows the most recent six closeouts for POWR Options. All 6 were overall winning trades with a holding period averaging just a few weeks. All very similar to the AYI/RBLX POWR Pairs trade. The ability to say nimble and be more neutral has served the POWR Options Portfolio so far. Our trading showed solid gains since inception versus losses for stocks in that same time frame. Using the POWR ratings to help us select the best of the best stocks to be bullish on with call buys, along with the worst of the worst stocks to be bearish on with put purchases, will likely continue to prove profitable in 2023.

Home Investing Stocks Stock Market Today: Apple Earnings, Bank Stocks Spark Relief Rally The April jobs report creates uncertainty around the Fed's future policy plans, but it didn't stop the major indexes from soaring Friday. Newsletter sign up Newsletter (Image credit: Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) By Karee Venema published 5 May 2023 Stocks rallied hard Friday despite a stronger-than-expected jobs report. A significant driver behind today's broad market gains was an impressive earnings report from mega-cap tech giant Apple (AAPL), while a rebound in regional bank stocks also lifted sentiment. Kiplinger's Weekly Earnings CalendarAhead of the opening bell, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U.S. added 253,000 jobs in April, blowing past estimates for an increase of 185,000. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.4% from 3.5%, while wage growth was up 0.5% month-over-month and 4.4% year-over-year.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Sign up Many of Wall Street's top minds were quick to chime in on the April jobs report, including Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. ""The jobs report was uncomfortably strong for policymakers who are trying to tame inflation,"" Peron says. ""The best you can say from today's report is that job growth is slowing when looking at the average over the past few months. However, wages were stubbornly high and that's a key aspect of the report for the Fed and markets.""So, while today's data does help ease recession worries, it creates uncertainty as to how long the Fed will keep interest rates elevated in its efforts to rein in inflation. Nevertheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.7% to 33,674, the S&P 500 soared 1.9% to 4,136, and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.3% to 12,235. The reason: Apple stock.Apple earningsShares of the blue chip stock jumped 4.7% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue thanks to record quarterly sales for both its iPhone and services segments. Apple also hiked its dividend by 4% and said it is boosting stock buybacks by an additional $90 billion.Apple wasn't the only stock making an outsized move today. After being walloped all week long, several regional bank stocks staged massive relief rallies. PacWest Bancorp (PACW) soared 81.7%, Western Alliance (WAL) surged 49.2% and Zions Bancorp (ZION) climbed 19.2%.Today's jobs data and AI stocksThere were some key figures in today's jobs report that caught the eye of Andrew Crapuchettes, CEO of RedBalloon. ""The number of people employed over the past year is up 3 million, or 1.9%, and wages are up 4.4%,"" Crapuchettes wrote in a blog post. ""Total unemployed since last year is down 311,000, or 5.2%."" And this, the executive adds, is ""likely why we see such a sudden rise in AI. There aren't enough people to get the job done, and AI is one avenue businesses are exploring to fill in the gaps.""Plenty of firms are already employing artificial intelligence. A study by IBM found that in 2022, 35% of companies were using AI in their businesses, with another 42% reportedly exploring AI. These figures will likely continue to increase as AI gains in popularity, and will boost the artificial intelligence market in the process. Indeed, the global AI market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 37.3% through 2023, according to Grand View Research.Investors wanting to capitalize on this rapid growth have plenty of opportunities at their disposal. But when looking for the best stocks to buy, it's important to focus on high-quality names like those included in Kiplinger's list of the best AI stocks. The 9 Best Vanguard Mutual Funds to Buy Explore More Stock Watch Markets Stock Market Today Apple (AAPL) Karee VenemaSocial Links NavigationContributing Editor, Kiplinger.comWith over a decade of experience writing about the stock market, Karee Venema is an investing editor and options expert at Kiplinger.com.

Coffey May 5, 2023 2:06 PM |  9 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Friday market open) Despite recession talk, the U.S. labor market continues to flex its muscle, with 253,000 jobs added in April. However, downward revisions to the last two jobs reports mean the labor market might not be quite as well-toned as today’s number suggests.Today’s April Nonfarm Payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job growth well above analysts’ expectations for around 180,000 and up sharply from a downwardly revised 165,000 in March. In fact, the government now says February and March jobs growth was a combined 149,000 less than it previously reported, which could ease worries that today’s higher number might lead the Federal Reserve to consider more interest rate hikes.Major indexes enter Friday in a four-day tailspin following this week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate hike, banking system worries, and rising volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average® ($DJI) turned negative for 2023 yesterday, though the S&P 500® index (SPX) and the Nasdaq 100® (NDX) remain in positive territory for now. Regional bank shares rebounded a bit this morning after getting crushed yesterday.Stock futures generally kept their earlier premarket gains after the jobs report, perhaps a sign that investors are becoming more worried about a possible recession than they are about the Fed. This report, which beat analysts’ expectations as every jobs report has over the last year, suggests continued resilience in the economy, though services-related businesses, not goods-producing ones, dominated jobs growth.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) jumped 5 basis points to 3.4% ahead of the jobs report. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) inched up to 101.36. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures eased to 18.94 from yesterday’s nearly one-month high. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) climbed to $70.48 per barrel. Treasury yields and crude both clawed back from recent losses early Friday—often a sign of improved investor sentiment about the economy. These remain helpful barometers.Just InToday’s robust jobs report comes two days after the latest Fed rate hike, which increased interest rates to more than 5%—their highest level in 16 years. The Fed’s been trying to slow economic growth, but the jobs market continues to gallop ahead. This raises the question of whether “good news is bad news.” Will this data cause the Fed to hike again next month?For now, the market is reacting positively to the solid economic news. Beyond the headline number and revisions to the prior two reports, things pretty much stayed in place. Labor market participation remained at 62.6%—about where it was before the pandemic. Unemployment of 3.4% was little changed from 3.5% in March and remains at historic lows.Also, a sharp downward revision to March jobs growth is catching some eyes this morning. It now stands at 165,000, down from the original 236,000.One worry on the inflation front is a 0.5% rise in hourly wages, which is above the 0.3% analysts had expected. Sectors that added the most jobs in April include business and professional services, health care, leisure and hospitality, and government. Manufacturing and construction employment were little changed.Stocks in the SpotlightApple AAPL beat analysts’ estimates for earnings per share (EPS) and revenue in its quarterly report released late yesterday, and the stock initially popped about 2%. The positive market response might have had more to do with AAPL’s announcement of a dividend increase and a $90 billion stock buyback than with quarterly results, which, with some exceptions, weren’t incredibly powerful and surpassed a relatively low bar from Wall Street. A miss of analysts’ expectations for the Services unit disappointed, but iPhone sales were a hit and helped buoy the quarter. Overall, it was the second straight quarter of declining year-over-year revenue for the tech giant. iPhone sales beat analysts’ expectations by more than $2 billion, though analysts say some of that may reflect pull-through from a weak holiday quarter as China reopened. In other words, the growth could be due to one-time circumstances. Services sales rose, but growth was below 6% in that key category for AAPL’s margin, and revenue came in under analysts’ expectations. Growth in Services, which includes the App store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay, has slowed significantly over the last year. Mac sales fell and looked weak, as many on Wall Street had expected, and iPad sales also declined. Sales in the closely watched China market continued to drop, offering another sign that perhaps the economy there isn’t recovering as quickly as expected. Qualcomm (QCOM) said earlier this week that it hadn’t seen evidence of a China recovery in the smartphone business, which is one reason AAPL’s better iPhone sales came as a bit of a surprise.Earnings Lull: The next phase of earnings season is a few weeks off when major retailers get their turns in the spotlight. Next week is a definite reprieve after two weeks of frenzied earnings releases, as most of the best-known companies in banking, tech, industrials and other closely watched sectors are done reporting. In normal times, this might represent a welcome easing in volatility, but with banking concerns front and center, that seems unlikely this time around.There are some high-profile companies reporting next week, including PayPal (PYPL), Duke Energy, (DUK), and UnderArmour (UAA). But none are more notable than Disney (DIS), which is expected to open its books on Wednesday after the close.Eye on the FedThe market sees a high likelihood that rates will be lower by the end of the year. The question is how do we get from where we are now to there? It would likely take a major disruption in banking or a severe downturn in economic prospects, or both, yet it’s still priced in. This could help explain why bearish market sentiment remains extremely elevated. The probability of a rate pause in June is 90%, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool. That’s down from 98% before the jobs report, and there’s now a 9% chance of a rate hike next month, up from 0% before the jobs report.The Fed’s quiet period around the FOMC meeting is over, so get ready for Fed speakers to make the rounds once more. Regional banking stocks plunged again yesterday after Canada’s Toronto-Dominion Bank Group called off its $13.4 billion takeover of First Horizon Corp (FHN). There’s talk on Wall Street about how to stop the sell-off in regional banks, including higher government deposit insurance guarantees or even a moratorium on the short selling of banking stocks, though this appears to be just talk for now.What to WatchInflation alert: Investors likely want to steel themselves for April Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) data next week. They’re due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Expectations on Wall Street are for CPI to rise 0.4% month-over-month and core CPI (which strips out energy and food) to climb 0.3%, according to Trading Economics. That’s compared with 0.1% and 0.4% in March. The core CPI is the one to watch most closely, keeping in mind that pricier gasoline in April likely influenced the headline number.Talking technicals: The SPX is closing in on what may be a key technical support point at 4,039, the 50-day moving average. The index came within a whisker of that intraday Thursday before rebounding slightly. Selling pressure could potentially pick up if that level gets breached. CHART OF THE DAY: A long-term chart of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (BKX—candlesticks), suggests that bank stocks may have another big drop in them. A 10-year graph reinforces that idea. If it hit the support level on the chart, the index would be down about 60% from its January 2022 high. Data source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investOracle time: Not the company, the one in in Omaha. This weekend’s Nebraska retreat features the latest views from Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. With all the bank jitters lately, investors might want to hear their thoughts on the regional banking industry. The two nonagenarians will also likely face questions about the Fed’s policy and the economy in general, as well as their company’s portfolio. A major holding of theirs, Apple (AAPL) could be in the spotlight after its earnings report yesterday, as well as oil companies, which Buffett recently built a heavy stake in only to see crude fall to late-2021 lows this week. It’s already been a wild two weeks for the market, but Buffett and Munger’s gathering may be one reason to put off your golf game this weekend.Shining on: While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell strongly hinted this week that he has no plans to cut rates absent an economic crisis, the gold market tells a different story. Gold futures (/GC) rose more than 1% Thursday and came within shouting distance of the metal’s all-time high of $2,089 an ounce, set back in August 2020. Gold isn’t just benefitting from hopes of lower U.S. rates; it’s also getting a lift from the U.S. dollar index, which continues to trade near 2023 lows. It’s still holding on to the 101 handle, but that’s down from nearly 115 last fall. Watch the dollar following today’s jobs report and next week’s U.S. inflation data to see if it gets a lift or not from economic activity.Earnings season update: Today brings the latest update on Q1 earnings from research firm FactSet, which comes amid generally better-than-expected Q1 results. The last FactSet estimate was for a 3.7% drop in year-over-year S&P 500 earnings, but some analysts now expect less than a 3% decline. What’s problematic is estimates coming down for later this year. Widespread hopes for earnings to rebound in the second half of the year have been fading, with some on Wall Street now penciling in overall S&P 500 earnings to drop slightly in 2023. With the S&P 500 index (SPX) still trading at a historically elevated forward multiple above 18, it may be hard for investors to get enthusiastic if it looks like earnings can’t at least slightly recover by year’s end.CalendarMay 8: March Wholesale Inventories and expected earnings from Tyson Foods (TSN) and PayPal (PYPL).May 9: Expected earnings from UnderArmour (UAA).May 10: April Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI, and expected earnings from Disney (DIS).May 11: April Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI and expected earnings from JD.com (JD).May 12: Preliminary May University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

Here’s how it works. Home Investing Stocks Stocks-to-buy Apple Stock Remains a Strong Buy Even as Shares Soar Apple stock has added more than $680 billion in value this year and it still has more room to run, analysts say. Newsletter sign up Newsletter (Image credit: Getty Images) By Dan Burrows published 5 May 2023 Apple (AAPL) stock popped after better-than-expected iPhone sales helped it beat Wall Street's quarterly profit and sales estimates – and analysts say shares in the mega-cap tech giant are just getting started.Apple stock jumped more than 5% at one point in early Friday trading thanks to upbeat fiscal second-quarter results released the previous evening. As a company with a market capitalization of more than $2.6 trillion at the beginning of the session, a 5% increase in Apple's stock price adds more than $130 billion in value to one of analysts' top Dow stocks. If You'd Put $1,000 Into Apple Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayFor the three months ended April 1, Cupertino, California-based Apple reported earnings of $1.52 a share, easily topping analysts' forecast for earnings per share (EPS) of $1.43, according to S&P Global Markets Intelligence. Revenue declined 3% to $94.8 billion, vs the Street's estimate for revenue of $92.8 billion. Subscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up ""We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release. The global smartphone market suffered a 15% decline in shipments during the first three months of 2023, according to market researcher IDC, and Apple was expected to go along for the ride. But unexpected strength in iPhone sales – quarterly segment revenue increased 2% year-over-year – helped Apple exceed the Street's expectations. Also boosting Apple stock were additional efforts to return more cash to shareholders. Apple upped its dividend by 4% to 24 cents per share quarterly. Furthermore, Apple's board of directors authorized an additional program to buy back up to $90 billion of AAPL stock. Apple stock: Buy, Hold or Sell?(Image credit: Getty Images)Apple stock has rallied an almost incomprehensible 33% for the year-to-date, adding roughly $680 billion in market value. To put that in perspective, including Apple, only five companies in the S&P 500 have market caps of more than $680 billion. And yet the Street says shares have plenty of upside left. Of the 45 analysts issuing opinions on Apple stock surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 25 rate it at Strong Buy, nine say Buy, nine call it a Hold, one says Sell and one rates it at Strong Sell. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Buy, with high conviction.We'll let Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang sum up the bullish investment thesis for Apple stock: ""We expect Apple's defensive moats to strengthen under the challenging macro backdrop, resulting in long-term, sustainable share gains in hardware and services.""Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy NowYang rates AAPL at Outperform (the equivalent of Buy), and raised his price target to $195 from $170. The new price target gives Apple stock implied price upside of 13% in the next 12 months or so.For context, the Street's highest price target of $210 gives Apple stock implied upside of 20%. At the other end of the range, Apple stock would have to fall 33% from current levels to hit the Street's lowest price target, which stands at $116. True, Apple beat a pretty low bar for estimates. But it did so resoundingly, and very much relied on the ""sticky"" ecosystem of products and services that no less an investing luminary than Warren Buffett praises.Don't forget: the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) calls Apple his ""third business."" That's why Apple is the Oracle of Omaha's top stock pick, accounting for nearly 40% of the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio. As one of the best stocks of the past 30 years – and a name that has generated stupendous wealth for anyone who bought Apple stock 20 years ago – it certainly is hard to bet against Apple. All 30 Dow Stocks Ranked: The Pros Weigh In Explore More Apple (AAPL) Dan BurrowsSocial Links NavigationSenior Investing Writer, Kiplinger.comDan Burrows is Kiplinger's senior investing writer, having joined the august publication full time in 2016.

Δ We're never going down ever again. You read that correctly, right? I read your emails and your chat comments. And a lot of you have called me irresponsible for saying that. To those calling me that, I have a question for you... Have you seen what's happening in the markets? When I say ""We're never going down ever again"", you need to understand what that means. Think about this statement in terms of what we do as traders. We aren't putting on call spreads or trying to predict where a stock will be next week, next month, or by the end of the year. Sign up for SMS so you never miss special events, exclusive offers, and weekly bonus trades. Your goal as a trader is to make yourself profits every day the market is open by making your plan, executing your trade, and getting out with a profit or a small loss. That's all we do. And if you're scared that a stock is going to go down, or you are shorting because you heard doom and gloom on the news... You need to change your mentality ASAP. Somehow, despite the fact that apparently the financial system is collapsing, the U.S. is about to default on its debt, inflation is out of control and WWIII is about to happen... The market is up to today and the QQQ is up 1.5%. Apple is up almost 5%. Draft Kings (DKNG) is up 15%. AMD is up 2%. The S&P 500 is up 60 points from yesterday. Who in their right mind is shorting this market? Because whoever it is, is getting crushed right now. I am never missing out on another long trade again. Remember what happened to me yesterday? I was calling out to buy Paramount (PARA) on the dip and missed my own trade. Members of Warlock's World got it, but I let my doubts and my emotions get the better of me. No more emotions. No more doubts. We find our patterns, we make our buys, we get in and we get out. AAPL today was a buy. DKNG was a buy. The Q's today were a buy. The more I hear some hack on CNBC tell the world that we're in a bear market, the more I love laughing in their face and making a bullish trade for the day. And if you want to laugh in their face with me...Then join me in the Warlock's World today! The post Buy the dip because we're never going down again appeared first on This Is VWAP.

Benzinga Contributor May 5, 2023 1:16 PM |  6 min read Short selling ban on bank stocks is likely about to happen. The White House is monitoring the short-selling pressure very closely. They need to avoid chaos and collapse at all costs. This is what they did in 2008.MarketPrices as of 4 pm EST, 5/4/23MacroThe US trade gap narrowed to a 4-month low in March. Exports increased by 2.1% to $256.2 billion while imports slowed by 0.3% to $320.4 billion as consumers spend less on goods and the labor market (slowly) cools. America’s trade deficit with China fell to its lowest since March 2020. The FDIC plans to refill its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) with help from fees imposed on big banks. The amount banks pay will be based on the size of their balance sheets and the number of depositors. Smaller banks with less than $10 billion in assets will be exempt from the special assessment fee. The proposal could be introduced as early as next week. Initial jobless claims in the US increased by the most in 6 weeks, rising more than expected to 242,000. The climb suggests some cooling in a resilient labor market. Continuing claims, on the other hand, dropped by 38,000, the largest decline since July. StocksPacific West Bancorp wants the world to know it is NOT PacWest Bancorp. The former made changes to the front page of its website to explicitly state it has no association whatsoever with the latter. Pacific West (not PacWest) shares trade over the counter at a $28 million market cap and have declined just 3.6% YTD. Meanwhile, the actual PacWest saw its value cut in half yesterday. Its decline led an index of regional banks down to levels not seen since September 2020. Also falling sharply was First Horizon, which watched shares drop 33% after its merger with TD Bank was terminated. Other big losers included Western Alliance (-38%) and Zion Bank (-12%). Investors will be turning to long-duration assets to hedge against a possible recession this year, according to JPMorgan strategists. That means increased demand for gold, tech stocks, and non-USD currencies. Gold is currently flirting with all-time highs while the share of tech in global equities has risen sharply, suggesting investors are increasingly overweight tech. EnergyUS oil prices are on pace for their third consecutive weekly drop after falling more than 8% this week. Prices briefly collapsed to their lowest intraday level since 2021 yesterday before rebounding. Despite the drop, the physical market remains tight which suggests the decline may be excessive. EarningsYesterday’s highlights: Apple AAPL: $1.52 EPS (vs. $1.43 expected), $94.84 billion in sales (vs. $92.96B expected). Apple topped expectations for iPhone sales but missed those for Mac and iPad. iPhone revenue increased 2% YoY while the broader smartphone industry contracted ~15% over the same period. Mac and iPad revenues, meanwhile, dropped 21% and 13% YoY, respectively. Overall revenue fell 3% YoY while net income declined by the same amount.

Fabino, Benzinga Staff Writer  May 5, 2023 12:13 PM |  3 min read Zinger Key PointsApple reported better-than-expected Q2 earnings, beating analysts' consensus estimates for earnings and revenue.Several analysts provided varied outlooks, with some raising price targets and others expressing concerns about weaker services growth.Apple Inc AAPL reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of fiscal year 2023. The stock is up nearly 5% during Friday’s intraday session, and several analysts updated their outlooks on the company following the earnings print.By The Numbers: The company's earnings per share came in at $1.52, beating the consensus estimate of $1.43 per share, while revenue totaled $94.8 billion, compared to analysts' forecast of $92.96 billion. Please enable Javascript to view this contentDespite a 3% year-over-year decline in revenue, Apple CEO Tim Cook and CFO Luca Maestri expressed satisfaction with the company's performance, noting that iPhone sales were strong in emerging markets including India, Indonesia, Turkey and the UAE.Check Out Beniznga's quote page for Apple.The Services segment revenue also hit a record high, although it grew at a slower rate of 5% year-over-year in the quarter. Several analysts weighed in on Apple's earnings, offering their opinions on the stock's outlook. The BofA Analyst: Wamsi Mohan reiterated his Neutral rating on Apple and set a price target of $176.Mohan praised the company's execution and iPhone sales growth, though he expressed concerns about the lack of a major catalyst to drive higher demand, a potential iPhone mix reversion and weaker Services growth in the near term.The Oppenheimer Analyst: Martin Yang provided an overview of Apple's supply chain derivatives, noting that the company's iPhone sales growth was a positive sign for suppliers including Qualcomm Inc QCOM, Qorvo Inc QRVO, Broadcom Inc AVGO, and Cirrus Logic, Inc. CRUS.He added that Apple's revenue mix was not as strong for its Mac and iPad segments.The Raymond James Analyst: Srini Pajjuri reiterated his Outperform rating on the stock and raised his price target from $170 to $180.Pajjuri cited Apple's solid earnings results despite a weak macro environment and foreign exchange headwinds, as well as the potential for relative stability in the company's revenue growth due to share gains in emerging markets and China reopening.The KeyBanc Analyst: Brandon Nispel maintained an Overweight rating on Apple and raised his price target to $180.Nispel highlighted the strong iPhone sales growth in emerging markets and the company's ability to weather macroeconomic headwinds. He noted Apple's revenue guidance was below consensus but in line with buy-side expectations and that the company's cost controls provided reasons to be optimistic.The Needham Capital Markets Analyst: Needham raised its price target on Apple to $195 and maintained its Buy rating.The firm highlighted Apple's installed base of more than 2 billion active devices, which drove nearly 2% year-over-year revenue growth and $28.6 billion of operating cash flow in the second quarter.Needham saw Apple as a safe investment option for investors amid an uncertain macro and consumer demand landscape.Apple's second-quarter revenues were $94.8 billion, down 3% year-over-year but 3% above the firm's estimate. The company's services revenue reached an all-time high at $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, while products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% year-over-year due to lower Mac and iPad revenue.The Bernstein Analyst: Toni Sacconaghi said Apple's second-quarter earnings were largely as expected. He noted the company's revenue growth was strong in emerging markets but relatively weak in the U.S. and the Americas.Apple's third-quarter revenue guidance appears conservative, according to Sacconaghi, who said the below-seasonal growth was due to unusual iPhone channel inventory replenishment in the second quarter and iPhone push-out from the first quarter into the second quarter, rather than an indication of slowing demand.While Sacconaghi expected modest downward revisions from consensus to FY23 estimates, he believed double-digit services growth was achievable in the next few years, despite more muted growth for advertising and the App Store.Price action: Shares of Apple are trading 4.85% higher to $173.84, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: AMC Entertainment Pops Higher On Q1 Earnings: What To Watch As The Stock Heads Toward Key LevelPhoto: ShutterstockEarningsAnalyst RatingsOptionsDividendsIPOsClick to see more Earnings updates© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Apple Inc gained 4.4% on better-than-expected results, helped by strong iPhone sales and notable inroads in India and other newer markets, fuelling a near 2% advance in technology stocks. Investors appeared to take in stride data showing US employers boosted hiring in April while raising wages, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for some time. The Labor Department's report showed non-farm payrolls increased by 253,000 last month, higher than economists' expectations of 180,000. Wages increased 4.4% year-on-year in April after climbing 4.3% in March, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.Also ReadApple opens its first official store in Mumbai; what we know so farApple BKC Mumbai store previewed ahead of April 18 opening: See picturesHere's a first look of the Apple store that opens in Mumbai tomorrowApple's Delhi store now open for public: 5 things you need to know about itApple posts record quarter in India; Cook says 'incredibly exciting market'Buddha inspired me to renounce violence, just like Ashoka: Nepal PMPakistan's Ex-PM Imran to face indictment on May 10 in Toshakhana caseCovid-19 no longer represents a global health emergency, says WHOVice-President Dhankhar reaches London for King Charles III's CoronationUS job growth beats expectations in April; unemployment rate falls to 3.4% ""This is a strong report and shows that the labor market is resilient. It bails out the Fed for raising another quarter point,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""It's been a tough week for the stock market, the regional banking problems have raised the fear factor, but Apple earnings came in strong. Stocks are coming up from near-term oversold condition."" Traders are betting the Fed will start easing the policy rate by September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with July before the release of the jobs data. The Fed raised its interest rate by 25 basis points as expected on Wednesday, but Chair Jerome Powell noted it was too early to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern. Wall Street fell on Thursday after PacWest Bancorp's move to explore strategic options deepened concerns about the health of regional banks, pulling down shares of peers and big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Co. PacWest rebounded on Friday with a 48.3% gain, while Western Alliance Bancorp bounced back 32.0%. Western Alliance on Thursday denied a report that it was exploring a potential sale. At 9:48 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 459.05 points, or 1.39%, at 33,586.79, the S&P 500 was up 50.85 points, or 1.25%, at 4,112.07, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 141.80 points, or 1.19%, at 12,108.20. Following upbeat results from megacap companies, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies in the first quarter to decline 0.9% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 5.1% drop expected at the start of April. Used-car retailer Carvana Co jumped 30.8% as it expects to post a profit in the current quarter and plans to further bring down excess used-car inventory. Lyft Inc slumped 19% as the ride-hailing company's strategy to claw back market share from rival Uber Technologies Inc with lower fares stoked concerns about a hit to its profit margins. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 6.06-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 43 new lows.

Apple raised its dividend for the 11th consecutive year. The stock remains a buy. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More The iPhone continues to generate remarkably robust sales, even in the face of headwinds. What happened Shares of Apple (AAPL 1.56%) are ending the week on a high note, gaining as much as 5.1%. As of 10:53 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 4.8%. The broader market was solidly in rally mode, which no doubt contributed to tech giant's rise. However, the biggest news was Apple's quarterly results, which were far better than many feared. So what In its fiscal second quarter (ended April 1), Apple generated revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3% year over year, resulting in earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, level with the year-ago period. Apple shareholders breathed a sigh of relief, having feared the combination of high inflation, rising interest rates, and continued economic uncertainty would have weighed more heavily on sales. To put the results in the context of Wall Street's expectations, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $92.9 billion and EPS of $1.43, so the tech titan cleared both hurdles with ease. Apple fans had other reasons to celebrate. Services was the highlight, with revenue rising to $20.9 billion -- an all-time record for the segment. iPhone sales also jumped, as revenue set a record of $51.3 billion, the highest ever for the fiscal second quarter. On the heels of its strong performance, Apple said it was raising its dividend to $0.24, an increase of 4%, payable on May 18 to shareholders of record as of the market close on May 15. This marks the 11th consecutive annual increase. The company also announced an additional $90 billion share repurchase plan, which will entitle remaining shareholders to an incrementally larger slice of its profits. Now what Naysayers have been waiting for the other shoe to drop, but Apple continues to largely defy the downturn. CEO Tim Cook suggested that consumer demand was holding up well and was particularly strong in emerging markets. Given the current economic headwinds, Apple was reticent to provide many specifics for the upcoming quarter, but analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue of $84.5 billion, an increase of about 2%, and EPS of $1.20, essentially flat. The consistent strength of Apple's business in the face of headwinds is a remarkable achievement. Its strong performance, industry-leading position, and shareholder-friendly practices make the stock a buy. Danny Vena has positions in Apple. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple.

Duggan, Benzinga Staff Writer  May 5, 2023 11:19 AM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsWarren Buffett is known for his brutal honesty and pragmatic approach to investing.Wall Street will be paying close attention to anything Buffett says about the banking sector.Billionaire investing legend Warren Buffett is set to host the Berkshire Hathaway, Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) annual shareholder meeting in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday.Not only will investors be watching closely to see what Buffett says about Berkshire, but they will also be paying attention to Buffett's take on the economy, the banking crisis, inflation and any other topics he is likely to cover at the meeting.What To Watch: Berkshire investors will first be looking for the company's first-quarter earnings numbers. Analysts are expecting Berkshire to report quarterly adjusted EPS of $3.16 and revenue of $77.55 billion. That number would represent 12.7% revenue growth from a year ago.Related Link: Understanding The Investor Sentiment Cycle: Your Emotions Are Your Worst Enemy Beyond the top and bottom-line numbers, Wall Street will be paying close attention to anything Buffett says about the banking sector. Bank of America Corp BAC is Berkshire's second-largest stock holding, and the company also has large stakes in Citigroup Inc C, Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK and UBS Group AG UBS.Buffett may also discuss his largest holding, Apple, Inc. AAPL, which traded higher on Friday following an earnings beat. Buffett may also address a number of general topics, such as his outlook for the economy, his thoughts on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy or his long-running bearishness on Bitcoin BTC/USD. Related Link: Tesla Reportedly Taps BYD Batteries To Power Model Y EVs In Germany Berkshire shareholders will be voting on six proposals on Saturday, all of which Buffett opposes. The proposals include a call for Berkshire to report on addressing climate change annually, and a proposal to remove Buffett from the chairman position. Buffett currently holds 32% of Berkshire's voting power, making it extremely unlikely any of the proposals will pass.Benzinga's Take: Buffett is known for his brutal honesty and pragmatic approach to investing. Federal Reserve officials, politicians and banking industry executives have all said the banking system is stable, but Buffett's take on the crisis and the credit markets could carry a lot of weight on Wall Street.Read Next: Western Alliance Stock Bounces Back After Bank Denies Reports Of Potential Sale, Alleges Short Sellers Involved: 'Shameful And Irresponsible'Photo: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Cook is betting that those markets will provide more opportunities for growth, with their youthful populations and relatively few iPhones. Shares of Apple rose more than 4% on Friday, putting the world's most valuable company on track for gains of around $120 billion in market capitalization. Apple said iPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.3 billion for its fiscal second quarter even as global smartphone shipments fell 13% in January to March, according to research firm Canalys, whose data showed Apple gained market share from Android phones. Apple said it set sales records in several countries across South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.Also ReadAhead of Saket store launch, Apple CEO Tim Cook to meet PM Modi todayApple opens its first official store in Mumbai; what we know so farCEO Tim Cook may visit India to launch Apple's first store in the countryApple India: Excited to build on our long-standing history, says Tim CookApple posts record quarter in India; Cook says 'incredibly exciting market'In a bid to make chat interesting WhatsApp introduces single-vote pollsGoogle to introduce Bard AI as homescreen widget on Pixel devicesSellers set to launch big discounts on smartphones to clear stockFirst two retail stores in India 'milestone' for Apple: CEO Tim CookApple, Samsung captures 96% of global smartphone operating profits ""We're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, a great opportunity for us in those markets,"" Cook told investors during a conference call. India is perhaps Apple's biggest focus. The company recently opened its first two retail stores there, in Mumbai and Delhi, and while Apple does not disclose revenue for the country, Cook told investors that it set a quarterly record and percentage growth was in very strong double digits year-over-year. ""There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there,"" Cook said on the conference call. Apple was the second biggest revenue generating brand in India in 2022, second only to Samsung as it gained 18% of the total value of smartphone shipments, according to research firm Counterpoint. For Apple, selling an iPhone in an emerging market represents more than just the sale of one device - it represents the chance to get consumers hooked on Apple devices and services over time. Customers who start with an iPhone might later add an Apple Watch or AirPods or sign up for subscription services. Cook said he saw opportunities for Apple in India in services but said that average revenue per user - a metric known as ARPU in the subscription business - would take time to catch up to Apple's other markets. USED IPHONE BOOM Part of the reason that Apple has been able to gain market share in both emerging and developed markets is the emergence of a booming market for used iPhones. Sales of refurbished iPhones rose 16% in volume globally during 2022. India led the growth with a 19% jump, according to Counterpoint, with iPhones accounting for 11% of secondary smartphone sales in India. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Apple's Cook said little of Apple's direct iPhone revenue comes from refurbished devices. However he said the company has tried to bolster the used iPhone market by offering trade-in deals on its iPhones and building them sturdy enough to last several owners. ""We encourage the market and it provides us an opportunity to hit some price points that we would not otherwise play in,"" Cook said in the interview.

Ongoing concerns of a slowdown in iPhone sales were put to rest on Thursday after Apple reported solid earnings results that exceeded analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line.While revenues declined for the second quarter in a row, falling about 3% year-over-year, the company's quarterly iPhone sales exceeded $51 billion, which beat analyst estimates by $2.5 billion. The strong sales in iPhone helped offset weakness in Apple's Mac and iPad divisions. For future growth, investors are looking forward to Apple's expected September launch of the iPhone 15, as well as its expansion into India, which the company mentioned nearly 20 times on its earnings call.Also giving Apple investors confidence is the company's announcement of a new $90 billion stock buyback program and a 4% increase to the company's quarterly dividend, to $0.24 per share. Shares of Apple jumped more than 5% on Friday, adding $135 billion to the company's market value, which stood at about $2.77 trillion.Here's how three Wall Street analysts reacted to Apple's solid earnings results.Wedbush: ""Lebron-like results from Cupertino.""Rating: Outperform, $205 price target""Cook & Co. delivered an impressive iPhone beat and gave a relatively upbeat outlook going forward that should give the Street further confidence that Cupertino is riding out this macro storm in Rock of Gibraltar-like fashion. An uptick in China demand speaks to further share gains that Apple is seeing with iPhone 14 Pro along with higher ASPs globally that we believe is now in the $900+ level giving Apple tailwinds in this market... Overall, Cook talked about a stable consumer demand environment with particular strength in emerging markets as Apple continues to aggressively bet on a number of key markets with India front and center,"" Wedbush said. JPMorgan: ""Negating Macro Headwinds with Execution.""Rating: Overweight, $190 price target""The results and guidance are exactly what investors were looking for from the company to feel reassured of its defensive positioning and at the same time the greater resilience of Big Tech in general in the current macro as well as on potential further macro deterioration, making it palpable to still keep paying 26x NTM earnings for AAPL shares. While we can see some investors squirm about a 26x earnings multiple, we believe the resilience of the business proving out in the numbers currently as well as the early part of the pandemic (2020) will amply justify the reasons to pay a premium,"" JPMorgan said.Goldman Sachs: ""iPhone continues to gain share.""Rating: Buy, $209 price target""We gain confidence in our Buy rating and believe AAPL shares continue to be attractive. First, the iPhone beat was driven by recapture of lost sales due to earlier supply issues as well as better-than-expected performance in developing markets... Second, Services revenue grew +5% yoy with all-time revenue records in App Store, Music, iCloud, and payments, continuing to prove Services to be a reliable source of long-term growth... Third, AAPL's generous shareholder capital return program continues to support the stock,"" Goldman Sachs said. Read next MI Exclusive Apple Apple stock More...

Δ Garrett Baldwin This morning, the Labor Department released its monthly update on U.S. jobs. The general expectation was for slower job growth in April, with around 178,000 new jobs. What we got was much, much more; nonfarm payrolls rose by 253,000. Unemployment is running at 3.4%, below predictions, and is tied for the lowest level since 1969. The key focus, though, is wage growth: Is the Fed's policy of raising interest rates doing enough to cool off wage inflation? The numbers suggest... no. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% for the month, up 4.4% from 2022. (While all this is happening, Sen. Bernie Sanders is now trying to more than double the minimum wage from $7.25 to $17.00.) Regardless of the news, we are looking today for reversion trades on just about every high-volume stock with options that we can get our hands on. On Fridays, specifically, we want to trade the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, alongside a host of stocks like Ford Motor Co. (F) and Apple Inc. (AAPL). This chart shows how we'll pick our shot... Sign up for SMS so you never miss special events, exclusive offers, and weekly bonus trades. We are looking for stocks to ""revert"" off the second standard deviation band that you see below. It happened yesterday at 10:30 AM, and 12 PM, allowing traders to either trade the SPY, the leveraged Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3X Shares (SPXL), or options on the SPY that expired at the end of the day. This strategy, which I'll outline later today, can be a really great way to mix risk-reward during  Friday trading sessions.

Here's What I'm Watching Today (May 5, 2023) Contagion: There are plenty of people now dancing on the grave of PacWest Bancorp (PACW), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL), and Bank of Hawaii Corp. (BOH). But we've reached a point where the insanity has translated into outright danger. It's important to stress that PacWest isn't exactly a crypto-bank with Barney Frank on the board of directors. It's brick-and-mortar operation, with quality loans with long-term relationships. If this spreads to a bank like PacWest, it can spread anywhere. There are two major forces at play here that require examination immediately. First, it's the basic nature of fractional reserve banking. But second, it's the advantages that the TBTF banks have over everyone else. A bank like PacWest takes deposits, puts money into safe Treasury bills, and, maybe, gets a 4.5% yield on the one-month T-bill. That's how long they'll wait for money... But a TBTF bank like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) (which has close to si… Join the conversation.

9:40 AM |  3 min read Apple Inc AAPL experienced its overall sales falling for the second consecutive quarter but still managed to exceed top and bottom line estimates due to recovered iPhone sales. Fiscal Second Quarter EarningsDuring the quarter that ended on April 1st, Apple’s revenue slipped 3% from $97.28 billion in the prior quarter to $94.84 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus of $92.96 billion. As a result, Apple made a net income of $24.16 billion compared to $25.01 billion in the year-earlier period.  The resulting EPS was $1.52 per share, topping the expected $1.43.Product Segmentation As CEO Tim Cook summed up, it was quite a good quarter from an iPhone point of view that generated $51.33 billion in revenue, especially when looked at market statistics as broader smartphone industry contracted nearly 15% during the period, according to an IDC estimate. StreetAccount consensus expected $48.84 billion. With iPhone revenue increasing 2% during the quarter, it is suggested that supply shortages and disruptions that have been plaguing the product for last few years have finally subsided. On the other hand, Mac and iPad didn’t score so well but Apple warned when it reported its previous quarter of this decline, they just fell more than expected. Mac generated $7.17 billion in revenue, below the expected $7.80 billion while iPad brought in $6.67 billion as revenue dropped almost 13% YoY, also below StreetAccount’s estimate of $6.69 billion. Although Mac sales dropped more than 31% YoY, it should be noted that this is a comparison to a period when Apple still benefited from the last days of the pandemic boom. Also, there’s the fact that Apple shifted to using its own chips that brought a longer laptop battery life. Other Products generated $8.76 billion in revenue, exceeding the expected $8.43 billion while services brought in $20.91 billion, below the expected$20.97 billion but marking an increase of 5.5% YoY which suggest that Apple’s focus to its highest-margin business is paying off. While sales contracted in most regions, Asia Pacific expanded to $8.11 billion.Outlook Cook announced that Apple is still resisting to layoffs which are the last resort. Meanwhile, Cook’s growth bet is on emerging markets such as India where Apple is luring away Android phone users. Apple recently open its first two stores in the country, in Mumbai and Delhi respectively. Apple managed to beat the odds and find new opportunities in a heavily hit market.Meanwhile, Qualcomm Inc QCOM outlook is now grim with Apple being its largest purchaser of standalone modem chips. On Wednesday, Qualcomm gave lower than expected forecasts for its third quarter revenue and profit as it expects the smartphone industry to take longer to use up excess chips before new orders for fresh ones come in. Although Qualcomm is hoping for smartphone sales to recover in China during the second half of the year, this market was among the first to be slashed by high inflation that weakened consumer spending and consequently, lowered the demand on discretionary goods such as electronics. Qualcomm’s CEO Cristiano Amon also noted that used phones are also replacing the sales of premium-tier devices. Back in 2022, Apple’s sales of refurbished iPhones confirmed this trend as they rose 16% across the globe.         RecapApple came out on top of the earnings week thanks to stronger than expected iPhone sales that make up more than half of its total revenue. It also achieved an all-time record in services with the March quarter record for iPhone in an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

The company announced its eleventh consecutive dividend increase. The stock remains a remarkable value -- when viewed in the context of its continue strong performance. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Despite multiple headwinds, demand for the iPhone remains high. Given the challenging environment, which includes economic uncertainty, high inflation, and rising interest rates, it isn't a stretch to say people are finding ways to spend less. A recent survey of more than 9,000 consumers found that 69% of respondents planned to cut back on nonessential spending, with 15% planning to eliminate nonessential spending altogether, according to a study by PwC. Investors have been concerned about the potential implications for Apple (AAPL 1.56%). After all, the company's high-end goods are considered by many to be a luxury, as the average price of an iPhone reached $988 last quarter, according to research firm CIRP. Yet Apple's results yesterday showed the enduring demand for the iPhone, which helped backstop the company's performance amid challenging conditions. Image source: Apple. Demand is strong despite headwinds For its fiscal second quarter (ended April 1), Apple generated revenue of $94.8 billion and while that was down 3% year over year, it was well ahead of analysts' consensus estimates of $92.9 billion. The key driver of the strong topline performance was iPhone revenue of $51.3 billion -- a record for the March quarter. Apple's flagship device generated revenue that was well ahead of expectations, as Wall Street had forecast iPhone sales of $48.7 billion. The iPhone continues to be the backbone of Apple's business, accounting for 54% of total sales during the quarter. Perhaps as importantly, strong pricing power helped Apple deliver robust profits as well, with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52 unchanged compared to the prior-year quarter, even as revenue edged lower. This was also markedly better than the $1.43 market watchers expected. Another headliner was services, a recurring revenue stream that Apple has been curating for the past several years -- fueled by the growing number of iPhones currently in use. Services revenue of $20.9 billion hit an all-time record, accounting for 22% of sales, also demonstrating resilience in the face of headwinds. Demand for the Mac didn't hold up as well, with sales of $7.2 billion falling 31%. The appetite for the iPad was similarly strained, with sales of $6.7 billion down about 13%. In typical Apple fashion, and without providing any specifics, CEO Tim Cook dropped this nugget: ""We are pleased to ... have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high."" While the company was mum as to the number of devices, we know it's higher than the 2 billion active devices it announced just last quarter. Services continued to generate strong growth -- and part of that is a function of the growing number of devices fueling that demand. Shareholders rejoice Strong sales and cost discipline give Apple the resources to continue its tradition of shareholder-friendly practices -- which was on full display. Apple's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share, an increase of 4%. This marks the eleventh consecutive increase since Apple reinstituted its payout back in 2012. The payout began at a split-adjusted rate of roughly $0.095, increasing by an impressive 153% since inception. While the yield appears low at just 0.55%, that's a function of Apple's spectacular growth (more on that in a minute). The company isn't stopping there. Given Apple's strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion, the board has also authorized an additional $90 billion stock buyback, which will increase the proportion of profits allocated to each share -- further enriching Apple investors. Remarkable value Apple continues to buck the broader market trend, with its stock down just 9% from its peak reached in early 2022. Yet considering its resilience, Apple stock is still a solid value, selling for just 28 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 24 for the S&P 500. While that's slightly more expensive, consider this: over the past decade, Apple stock has gained 929%, and generated total gains of 1,110% when factoring in the dividend. Comparing that to the S&P's total return of 207% during the same period, helps illustrate not only that Apple's premium is well-deserved, but also what a compelling buy the stock is at this price.

Club holding Apple (AAPL) delivered better-than-expected quarterly results Thursday, with its installed base of active devices expanding to more than 2 billion. Apple's board authorized a program to repurchase up to $90 billion worth of stock, while raising its quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share. 2. A slate of banks increased their price targets on Apple on Friday. These included Morgan Stanley, which raised its target to $185 per share, from $180, and Deutsche Bank which lifted its target to $180, from $170. Both firms reiterated the equivalent of buy ratings. Piper Sandler, meanwhile, was an outlier — lowering its price target on Apple to $180, from $195, even as it maintained an overweight rating on shares. 3. Shares of Club name Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed up more than 6% Thursday on a Bloomberg report that Microsoft (MSFT), another Club stock, is helping the chipmaker expand into artificial intelligence processors. 4. Club holding Coterra Energy ( CTRA) delivered a first-quarter earnings beat Thursday, while reaffirming its commitment to regularly return at least half of its free cash to shareholders. Currently, Coterra said it plans to return a total of $420 million to shareholders, representing about 76% of its free cash flow in the first quarter. 5. Barclays raised its price target on Bausch + Lomb (BLCO) to $18 a share, from $17, citing its ""attractive growth profile."" The firm maintained an equal weight rating on BLCO shares. The eye-health products company holds the key to saving Club holding Bausch Health (BHC), which is in the process of unravelling its majority stake . 6. JPMorgan raised its price target on Kellogg (K) to $72 a share, from $68, while upgrading its rating to neutral, from underweight. The firm cited improved fundamentals at the food manufacturing giant. 7. DoorDash (DASH) received three price target raises following strong first-quarter earnings. Barclays increased its target to $75 a share, from $70, and maintained an equal weight rating. UBS lifted to $70 a share, from $68, maintaining a neutral rating. Oppenheimer raised to $85 a share, from $80, and reiterated an outperform rating. 8. Shares of Peloton Interactive (PTON) closed down more than 13% Thursday after the company reported a greater-than-expected loss for its fiscal third quarter — though, the reason why remains impenetrable. 9. Manufacturing firm Parker-Hannifin (PH) delivered a quarterly earnings beat Thursday, and there is no sign of a slowdown. Baird on Friday raised its price target on PH to to $415 a share, from $411, while maintaining an outperform rating on the stock. 10. Wells Fargo raised its price target on Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) to $88 a share, from $78, and kept its overweight rating on the stock. The firm cited ""robust"" cruise demand and RCL management's solid execution following the company's first-quarter results. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)
