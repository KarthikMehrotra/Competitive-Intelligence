increase in smartphone penetration - Technavio News provided by Technavio 07 Apr, 2023, 21:00 ET Share this article Share this article NEW YORK, April 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The mobile value-added services (VAS) market is set to grow by USD 723.25 billion from 2022 to 2027 progressing at a CAGR of 15.76% during the forecast period. The report offers an up-to-date analysis regarding the current global market scenario, the latest trends and drivers, and the overall market environment. The market is driven by the rapid increase in smartphone penetration. Consumers are increasingly using their mobile devices for a variety of purposes, from gaming and web browsing to e-commerce and social media interactions. Moreover, mobile phone manufacturers also offer a wide range of smartphone deals at competitive prices, and consumers can choose smartphones that meet their specific needs. Smartphone penetration will continue to grow, especially in emerging markets such as India and China, due to improvements in internet speed and technological infrastructure. This is anticipated to drive the mobile communications market (VAS) during the forecast period. Here is an exclusive report about market scenarios with a historical period (2017-2021) and forecast period (2023-2027). Download a Sample Report! Continue Reading Technavio has announced its latest market research report titled Global Mobile Value-added Services Market 2023-2027 The mobile value-added services (VAS) market covers the following areas: Mobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market SizingMobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market ForecastMobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market Analysis Mobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market 2023-2027 - Market Dynamics Trend: The increasing popularity of AR in location-based games is another major factor supporting the mobile value-added services (VAS) market growth. The adoption of AR in location-based games, where virtual content is layered over real-world surroundings and objects, is increasing. The growth in popularity of AR in location-based games can be attributed primarily to platform flexibility. The growing trend of game offerings that merge AR with LBS is expected to attract significant investment from key mobile VAS providers such as Alphabet and Apple. This, in turn, will drive the mobile games segment, thereby fueling the growth of the global mobile value-added services (VAS) market. Challenge: The constraints in content monetization will be a major challenge for the mobile value-added services (VAS) market. Traditionally, the major revenue share for mobile service providers was generated from voice calls. However, owing to the rapid reduction in call tariffs and the advent of popular online calling applications and IM services, which provide free voice and video calling services, the revenue generated from voice calls has declined drastically. Hence, monetizing content to substitute voice call revenue is expected to hinder the growth of the global mobile value-added services (VAS) market.Mobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market 2023-2027: Market SegmentationThe report offers an up-to-date analysis regarding the current global market scenario, the latest trends and drivers, and the overall market environment. The market is segmented by product (mobile advertising, mobile games, mobile music and video streaming, mobile money and m-commerce, and mobile publications), end-user (large enterprises, small, and medium enterprises), and geography (APAC, North America, Europe, South America, and Middle East and Africa).The market growth will be significant in the mobile advertising segment during the forecast period. With the rapid adoption of mobile broadband, video advertising offers consumers an attractive format in a non-intrusive manner. These ads are typically placed in over-the-top (OTT) applications and social media platforms, with consumer clicks and application installs being key parameters for measuring advertiser revenue generation. Certain developing markets such as Africa and South America still depend primarily on SMS and MMS advertising, though the growth of mobile broadband in these markets will see a shift toward mobile internet-based advertising during the forecast period. This report presents a detailed picture of the market by the way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources through an analysis of key parameters - View a Sample ReportCompanies MentionedThe global mobile VAS market is highly competitive, with the presence of many international and domestic vendors. Many new players are entering the market, especially in emerging markets, as the rapid adoption of smartphones and the high penetration of mobile broadband services are increasing the demand for mobile VAS among consumers. However, major international players have a competitive advantage due to higher investment opportunities and diversified product portfolios, which will help them compete during the forecast period.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Is Lumentum Stock a Buy Now? By Leo Sun – Apr 7, 2023 at 9:59AM Key Points Lumentum’s stock tumbled after the company released its Q2 earnings report. Its cyclical challenges, competitive threats, and customer concentration issues are difficult to overlook. Its stock deserves to trade at a discount to its industry peers. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: LITE Lumentum Market Cap $4B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.70%) $0.91 Current Price $54.20 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The optical chip and laser manufacturer faces a lot of near-term headwinds. Lumentum's (LITE 1.70%) stock plunged nearly 10% on April 6 after the producer of optical chips and lasers posted its latest earnings report. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which ended on Dec. 31, its revenue rose 13% year over year to $506 million but missed analysts' expectations by $1 million. Its adjusted net income dropped 13% to $104 million, or $1.52 per share, but still cleared the consensus forecast by $0.20. Lumentum's growth rates were lumpy, but its stock had already been cut in half over the past 12 months and trades at just 9 times forward earnings. Should investors take the contrarian view and buy this beaten-down tech stock? Image source: Getty Images. A cyclical stock with customer concentration issues Lumentum generated 89% of its revenue from its optical communications chips in the second quarter. This segment produces optical chips for service providers, as well as 3D-sensing chips for mobile devices, cars, 3D printers, and other industrial machines. The remaining 11% came from its sales of commercial manufacturing lasers. Lumentum's largest customers are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Ciena (NYSE: CIEN), which accounted for 29% and 13% of its revenue, respectively, in fiscal 2022. Lumentum's 3D-sensing chips and lasers power Apple's Face ID features, but TF International Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo believes Apple plans to replace Lumentum's lasers with Sony's (NYSE: SONY) in the iPhone 15 Pro. Kuo claims that loss could represent a ""long-term structural risk"" to Lumentum's business. Lumentum's dependence on Ciena has also raises red flags. In a statement issued with its second-quarter report, Lumentum CEO Alan Lowe said ""a network equipment manufacturer who represented more than 10% of our fiscal second quarter revenue"" (most likely Ciena) ""would not take the shipments we had originally projected"" due to inventory management issues. Those customer concentration issues and the broader macro headwinds caused many investors to shun Lumentum. Inorganic growth with declining margins Lumentum's top-line growth accelerated over the past year, but most of that growth came from its acquisition of NeoPhotonics last August. It claimed that acquisition would generate $50 million in synergies over the following two years, but component shortages and the integration of NeoPhotonics' lower-margin optoelectronic products (which are used to transmit optical signals) still reduced its adjusted gross and operating margins over the past year. Metric Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Revenue Growth (YOY) 6.7% (5.7%) 7.7% 13% 13.3% Adjusted Gross Margin 51% 49.5% 50.4% 48.2% 44.9% Adjusted Operating Margin 31.7% 26.5% 28.8% 27.1% 23.1% Data source: Lumentum. YOY = Year-over-year. Therefore, Lumentum's revenue growth will likely decelerate after it laps its acquisition of NeoPhotonics, while the component shortages and macro headwinds could continue to squeeze its margins. Its outlook for the third quarter backed that bearish view. It expects its revenue to only rise 9% to 16% year over year, mainly due to its unexpected loss of Ciena's orders, compared to analysts' expectations for 19% growth. And even though it's reining in its spending, it still expects its adjusted operating margin to contract to 17% to 19%. For the full year, Lumentum expects its revenue to come in at the low end of its prior guidance for 12% to 20% growth as its adjusted EPS declines 10% to 15%. Analysts currently expect its revenue to increase 11% as its adjusted EPS slides 12%. For fiscal 2024, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow by about 4%. There aren't any compelling reasons to buy Lumentum Lumentum's valuation could limit its downside potential, but its cyclical headwinds, competitive challenges, and customer concentration issues are impossible to overlook. There are also plenty of better diversified tech stocks that are still on sale as the bear market drags on, so I can't recommend buying Lumentum right now. Leo Sun has positions in Apple.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research These 2 Stocks Make Up 53% of Warren Buffett's $342 Billion Portfolio By Sean Williams – Apr 7, 2023 at 5:06AM Key Points The Oracle of Omaha has vastly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 since he became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s. Berkshire's $342 billion portfolio owns stakes in 49 securities, but more than $180 billion of invested assets are tied up in just two stocks. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Portfolio concentration is the unsung hero of Berkshire Hathaway's long-term success. Few people garner attention from everyday and professional investors quite like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.36%) (BRK.B -0.50%) CEO Warren Buffett. Despite being fallible like every other investor, the Oracle of Omaha has outpaced the total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 by a factor of 153 since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s -- a 3,787,464% return for Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), versus 24,708% for the S&P 500, as of Dec. 31, 2022. Buffett's not-so-subtle secrets to success are aplenty. He has a relatively narrow research focus, tends to buy profitable, dividend-paying, time-tested businesses, and prefers to hold those positions for long periods. But the factor that might be most responsible for Berkshire Hathaway's outperformance is portfolio concentration. Buffett has long believed that diversification is only necessary if you don't know what you're doing. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. As of the closing bell on April 4, 2023, Warren Buffett and his team oversaw a $342 billion investment portfolio containing 49 securities (47 stocks and two exchange-traded funds). A whopping 53% of Buffett's portfolio was tied up in just two stocks, even though Buffett had a boatload of capital to work with. (Note, this figure includes assets from the Oracle of Omaha's secret portfolio, New England Asset Management.) Apple: $151,644,266,071 (44.4% of invested assets) There's absolutely no question that Warren Buffett enjoys running a relatively concentrated portfolio, once you take a closer look at Berkshire Hathaway's stake in tech-stock Apple (AAPL 1.56%). Labeled as one of Berkshire's ""four giants"" by the Oracle of Omaha in his 2021 letter to shareholders, Apple is closing in on a 45% weighting within Berkshire's portfolio. Apple checks all the right boxes for the long-term-minded Warren Buffett. For starters, it's one of the most well-known companies in the world and has quite the loyal customer base. Interbrand has labeled Apple the world's most valuable brand for 10 years running, while Kantar BrandZ announced last year that, based on its survey, Apple had reclaimed the top spot in brand value. The company's products are also well-loved. Since late 2020, which is when Apple's first 5G iPhone hit sales floors, the company has accounted for around 50% of all U.S. smartphone market share. Likewise, Apple's share of U.S. personal computer (PC) shipments is on the rise. The 17.2% share of the PC market that the company's Mac computers claimed in the fourth quarter of 2022 was a decade high. However, Berkshire's $151.6 billion stake in Apple is also a reflection of Warren Buffett implicitly trusting Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While not abandoning the physical products that made Apple what it is today, Cook is leading an ongoing shift to a subscription-driven operating model. Focusing on services should help Apple generate predictable, high-margin revenue. Further, it'll help minimize the revenue ebbs and flows that are often observed during iPhone replacement cycles. But the biggest lure of all might just be Apple's capital-return program. In terms of nominal dollars, the nearly $14.6 billion Apple doles out in dividends each year to its shareholders is one of the largest payouts on the planet. The company has also repurchased well over $550 billion worth of its common stock over a 10-year period. These buybacks are growing Berkshire's stake in Apple without Buffett's company lifting a finger. There's no question Apple has been a phenomenal investment for Warren Buffett and his team. But with its growth engine stalled and its valuation inflated, relative to where it was even five years ago, I believe it's fair to suggest that Apple isn't very attractive at its current price. Image source: Getty Images. Bank of America: $28,899,199,128 (8.5% of invested assets) The other top holding that collectively accounts for 53% of invested assets in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is Bank of America (BAC -0.24%). Inclusive of Buffett's secret portfolio, Berkshire holds more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA. Of all the sectors and industries the Oracle of Omaha can invest in, there's arguably none he understands better than banking. In particular, Buffett appreciates the cyclical nature of the industry. Cyclical stocks operate in lockstep with the U.S. or global economy. They thrive during economic expansions and struggle during contractions. But even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, they're usually short-lived. Every recession after World War II has lasted just two to 18 months. Comparatively, expansions are often measured in years. Buffett and his investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are leaning on history and allowing their cyclical stocks to benefit from these long-winded expansions. There's no need to time the market when bull markets are disproportionately longer to begin with. However, Warren Buffett wouldn't be holding a $28.9 billion stake in Bank of America if there weren't company-specific catalysts, as well. Perhaps the biggest of these is the company's interest-rate sensitivity. As a general rule, bank stocks benefit when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Lending institutions with outstanding variable-rate loans should enjoy an increase in net interest income when rates climb. Under normal conditions, the nation's central bank would be cutting rates in response to a weaker economy or a bear market for equities. But with the U.S. inflation rate coming off four-decade highs in June 2022, the Fed has little choice but to tackle its most pressing issue. As rates continue to rise, no money-center bank is reaping the benefit more than Bank of America. Something else you might not realize about BofA is that it's done an admirable job of incorporating technology into the banking experience. As of the end of 2022, it had 44 million digital users, and its members were completing just shy of half of all loan sales online or via a mobile app. Additionally, 63 million more digital Zelle payments were sent during the fourth quarter than checks were written. Digital transactions are notably more cost-effective than in-person interactions for banks. Lastly, it's pretty evident Warren Buffett trusts BofA CEO Brian Moynihan. On top of fortifying Bank of America's balance sheet following the Great Recession, Moynihan and BofA's board haven't been shy about rewarding their faithful shareholders.

April 6, 2023 12:55 PM |  7 min read Advertiser DisclosureFinancial industry turmoil and debate over the Fed’s rate path set the stage for a Q1 earnings season that might raise more questions about corporate health than it answers.Major banks and airlines open the season in mid-April after a disappointing Q4 that saw S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) fall nearly 4%. The slump is widely expected to worsen in Q1, falling more than 6% year over year, according to research firm FactSet.The definition of an “earnings recession” is when earnings decline two quarters in a row. If analysts are right, we’re about to be in one.What’s the problem? A bunch of things, including the strong dollar, slowing consumer and business demand, tough comparisons versus year-ago earnings, and rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve again tightened the screws at its March meeting. All these factors can slow earnings growth, with some sectors pressured more than others.One thing you probably can’t blame for Q1’s troubles—though it’s likely to have an impact later this year—is the recent banking turmoil. More on that below.More pain seen aheadBefore touching on Q1 earnings expectations by sector, let’s review a few reasons why many analysts remain bearish on the earnings outlook for Q1 and beyond: Recent downward momentum in revisions by companies. Through late March, 79 S&P 500 companies had issued negative earnings per share guidance for Q1 versus just 27 that issued positive guidance, according to FactSet. The lagging impact of tighter monetary policy is still working through the economy and input costs remain high for many segments of the market, says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab. Decelerating growth continues to weigh on productivity. The Leading Economic Index (LEI) from The Conference Board fell again in February and is down month over month for 11 consecutive months (a streak only seen during recessions). The ISM Manufacturing Index’s new orders component remains in contraction where it’s been for six consecutive months. Rapid disinflation on the goods side of the economy is sending a worrisome signal for revenue and profits, especially given S&P revenue growth in 2022 was mostly due to high inflation (unit growth was mediocre), Sonders notes. Beyond that, recent layoffs across the info tech sector, including Amazon’s (AMZN) late-March announcement that it would lay off workers in its cloud business, has driven negative sentiment heading into earnings. The mega-cap tech companies, including AMZN, Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) all disappointed with their earnings last time out, and more negative news from any or all of them might taint this earnings season, too.That said, it’s likely that big banks will set the tone as they kick off the earnings season the middle of next month as they’re center stage in the recent financial turmoil. Big Q1 declines seen for materials, real estate, health careEight of 11 S&P 500 sectors are expected to see earnings fall year over year in Q1, according to research firm CFRA, with the worst losses coming from materials, real estate, health care, and communication services. However, consumer discretionary, industrials, and energy all could see better than 13% year-over-year EPS gains in Q1, CFRA forecasts. The closely watched financials sector is expected see EPS fall nearly 8% in Q1 and fall more than 2% for calendar year 2023, CFRA says.Analysts expect a 6.6% earnings decline across all sectors in Q1, according to FactSet’s latest data released March 31. That reflects declining hopes since the start of the year, when the average Q1 estimate was for just a slight decrease, according to FactSet. The trend for nearly a year now has been falling analyst estimates over the course of the quarter as companies guide lower. Materials, consumer discretionary and industrials are the three sectors where earnings estimates have fallen most since the start of the year, FactSet noted. Familiar companies that have seen estimates fall substantially include Amazon, Tesla (TSLA), United Airlines (UAL), and Boeing (BA).While CFRA still sees overall 2023 S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) falling just slightly from last year’s $219.25, some analysts are far more bearish, projecting EPS of $200 or less.Banking turmoil’s impactThe elephant in the room is credit, both for consumers and businesses, and it could tighten if banks and their balance sheets come under more scrutiny. Banks may become more reluctant to lend to certain businesses, which could dry up venture capital, commercial real estate, and other businesses dependent on a relatively free flow of funds.Ultimately, this would likely lead to slower economic growth and almost certainly to less direct business for banks. Keep an eye on credit spreads to get a sense of whether business activity is slowing, which would likely factor into falling earnings expectations as the year advances.There’ve also already been more calls for bank regulation in the wake of this instability. Tighter regulation, if it comes, often means narrowing opportunity for banks to grow their businesses.Earnings, even more than the Fed, play directly into stock valuations. Heading into earnings season, the SPX had a 12-month forward Price-Earnings (P/E) ratio near 18, close to the 10-year average, according to FactSet. That sounds relatively benign, and certainly could be if the “E” part of the equation remains stable. Analysts expect earnings to rebound smartly later in 2023, thanks in part to hopes for an improving economy and easier comparison to the previous year in coming quarters.With Q1 earnings not even started, it’s a bit early to start worrying about the full year. But if analysts start rolling back their earnings estimates for later this year, P/E could start looking higher than normal unless the SPX declines. That’s why company guidance in coming weeks for Q2 and beyond is so important and will likely invite as much or more scrutiny as Q1 performance numbers roll in. Analysts have their pencils and scorecards ready, so to speak, and could mark them with red ink if they don’t like what they hear from some of the major companies. If the red ink flows toward full-year earnings expectations, it’ll be tough sledding for market bulls hoping for a 2023 Fed “pause” rally or a possible rate cut by later this year. The Fed can perhaps take its foot off the brake a bit, though inflation remains near 5%, making that a tough call.  But if companies can’t find a way to improve margins and boost profits, any stock market rally based on rates could be called into question. In late March, for instance, Nike (NKE) shares slipped despite strong earnings, hurt by worries over the company’s slumping gross margin amid inventory issues. Margins come into sharp focus during earnings season, and more companies could see their stocks punished if they can’t promise better profits ahead. Unfortunately, inflation remains a problem, giving companies the unappetizing choice of raising prices or eating the higher wholesale costs (and hurting their margins). In late March, for instance, Nike (NKE) shares slipped despite strong earnings, hurt by worries over the company’s slumping gross margin amid inventory issues. Margins come into sharp focus during earnings season, and more companies could see their stocks punished if they can’t promise better profits ahead. Unfortunately, inflation remains a problem, giving companies the unappetizing choice of raising prices or eating the higher wholesale costs (and hurting their margins).Bright Spot?Though earnings season is still over a week away, a smattering of company reports in the final week of March inspired some optimism in a market that’s grown used to expecting poor quarterly results. When you look over the companies that reported recently, including Walgreen’s Boots Alliance (WBA), lululemon (LULU), Micron (MU), Carnival (CCL), McCormick (MCK), and Paychex (PAYX), there was a lot to like even if not all of them sounded incredibly optimistic about the rest of the year.By and large, these firms either beat Wall Street’s expectations or gave investors reasons to hope the worst of their earnings struggles may be behind.Another positive feature in the recent flurry of company reports was the top line, which is a lot harder for corporate finance whizzes to dress up. The bottom line is typically where you can find ways to “window dress” a quarter and make it look a bit healthier than it may have actually been. Revenue, on the other hand, is going to either be good or bad, and kind of speaks for itself. Approximately 75% of S&P companies that reported in March’s final week beat analysts’ revenue expectations. That’s an area to watch as earnings season begins.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

Benzinga Editor April 6, 2023 12:01 PM |  2 min read Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterates a Hold rating on Walt Disney Co DIS. The re-rating reflects rising DTC losses and Martin's belief that consensus estimates for Disney are too high owing to high investment levels in DTC and another year of weak earnings from linear TV and the box office. Longer-term, Martin believes Disney's asset mix of both digital and physical assets (i.e., an Omniverse) maximizes its economic value capture.Martin sees Disney as the streaming winner in the longer term, backed by superior marketing skills, lower SAC, strong IP franchises, A+ library titles, and world-class storytellers at Pixar, Lucas Films, and Marvel and ownership of its content studios.Disney best in class library positions it for success in metaverse or AI like ChatGPT.CEO Bob Iger ""won"" the battle in Florida against Florida governor Ron DeSantis by promising to invest $17 billion in Florida to create 13,000 new Disney jobs, accusing DeSantis of being anti-business, and defending Disney's point of view by using ""freedom of speech and ideas"" metaphors. However, Iger's 2-year contract has 18 more months.Martin believes OTT consolidation will begin in 2023, and Disney will command the highest takeover premium. Martin sees Apple Inc AAPL, Microsoft Corp MSFT, and Amazon.Com Inc AMZN are logical bidders for DIS's 100-year-old brands and library IP. Disney has promised $5.5 billion of cost savings, including non-content cost savings of $2.5 billion ($1 billion in FY23) and content cost savings of $3 billion. Disney has already announced a 7,000-person headcount reduction. Also, Disney promised peak losses in streaming last year, which should drive faster EPS growth upside in FY23.Martin highlights Disney's dividend reinstatement potential. Martin believes Disney's natural shareholder base is retail investors wanting to put Disney shares into their retirement accounts. However, this same group of investors often requires dividends to live on. By implication, if Disney reinstates its dividend, a large pool of buyers for Disney shares will return to the stock.DIS's promised reorganization by YE23 into three core segments (Disney Entertainment, ESPN, Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products) highlights Disney's creative engine at the core of its value proposition. Martin believes the reorganization will aid morale while cutting costs. Also, Martin would like to see Disney auction off a 10% passive interest in ESPN and use that cash to repay debt and use ESPN-specific equity to lower the cash cost per year for the upcoming NBA renewal rights for ESPN.Price Action: DIS shares traded lower by 0.36% at $98.98 on the last check Thursday.EarningsAnalyst RatingsOptionsDividendsIPOsClick to see more Analyst Ratings updates© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement CIEN +1.61% LITE +0.62% AAPL -0.14% Ciena Corp. reaffirmed its outlook Thursday after optical-networking component maker Lumentum Holdings Inc. lowered its own forecast the previous afternoon, citing an order cancellation from a major customer.  See also: Lumentum stock sinks nearly 10% after forecast revision Networking company Ciena CIEN, +1.61% continues to expect $1.035 billion to $1.115 billion in fiscal second-quarter revenue, along with adjusted gross margins in the low 40% range and adjusted operating expenses of about $335 million.  Additionally, Ciena is sticking with its full-year outlook for 2023, which calls for 20% to 22% revenue growth, adjusted gross margins of 42% to 44% and adjusted operating expenses of about $330 million a quarter for the balance of the period.  Ciena “is reaffirming its previous statements with respect to both the demand environment and the normalization of backlog and inventory dynamics,” the company said in a release.  Shares of Ciena, off as much as 8.2% earlier in Thursday morning’s action, were paring losses and down 4.7% after the company gave its update.  Lumentum LITE, +0.62% disclosed late Wednesday that it no longer expected to meet its prior revenue forecast, as a corporate customer that made up more than 10% of its quarterly revenue in the fiscal second quarter had canceled an order late in Lumentum’s fiscal third quarter. In Lumentum’s last annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company disclosed only Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.14% and Ciena as representing more than 10% of its sales. Analysts generally seemed to think Ciena was the customer Lumentum was referring to, though Jefferies analyst George Notter didn’t think the update should necessarily spark concern.  “We don’t believe the [Lumentum] pre-announcement tells us much about fundamental end-market demand for Ciena, positively or negatively,” Notter wrote overnight, prior to Ciena’s own update.  Notter offered that there could be “a number of reasons” Ciena might have canceled an order, including that lead times for Lumentum components were coming down or that Ciena “simply over-bought from Lumentum relative to their business outlook,” among other possibilities.

Thankfully, depositors didn't lose any money, but the crisis left at least one important lesson behind. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Understanding a company's cash position should be part of every investor's due diligence process. The banking industry, government regulators, and investors alike are still processing the March 10 collapse of SVB Financial, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). It was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, with $175 billion in customer deposits on the line. But this crisis had one unique (and worrying) feature: Just 6% of those deposits fell within the $250,000 deposit insurance limit mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Most of SVB's customers were technology companies, investors, and high-net-worth individuals, which meant the majority of them faced the prospect of a total loss. Regulation saved the day Thanks to prudent regulations that prevent banks like SVB from using customer funds to make risky investments, there actually wasn't an asset shortfall at all -- in other words, the bank was in a position to cover all deposits, it just had to liquidate its investment portfolios (it had an estimated $209 billion in assets at the time of failure). Those portfolios consisted mostly of bonds and government Treasury bills, which are typically incredibly safe assets. But the rapid increase in interest rates over the last 18 months pushed the value of those bond portfolios lower (when a bond yields a higher interest rate, its value falls, and vice versa). At the same time, SVB's tech-sector customers were raising less money and burning through more cash, which was shrinking its deposit base. Additionally, customers were moving money to higher-yielding accounts, money market funds, and Treasury bills themselves to earn more interest on their deposits. A combination of those factors forced SVB to liquidate $21 billion worth of bonds and Treasuries at a $1.8 billion loss so it could meet depositors' requests. The bank then attempted to raise money from investors to plug that hole, and when word began to circulate the institution might be in trouble, depositors began to flee en masse. SVB expected to lose a whopping $100 billion in deposits on the Friday that it failed which it didn't have the liquidity to cover, but thanks to a lightning-fast intervention by the FDIC, the bank was shut down before that could happen. It allowed the federal government to step in and announce deposits of all sizes would be safe, and it also gave the Federal Reserve time to set up an ""at-par"" lending facility to banks, which meant they could temporarily plug any financial holes caused by the declining values of their bond portfolios. This measure shored up customers' confidence in the rest of the banking system. But this crisis came with important lessons attached, even if you don't invest in banks or financial sector stocks. Here's one thing technology investors can take away from the SVB collapse. Invest in companies with ultrastrong balance sheets A company has a strong balance sheet if it has enough cash and short-term liquidity to comfortably service its liabilities, like loans and other costs. Fortunately, the technology sector is filled with great examples -- two of the best are fierce rivals Apple (AAPL 1.56%) and Microsoft (MSFT 1.10%). Both have built their fortress balance sheets on the backs of their incredible cash-generating businesses. In fact, Apple brings in so much money it returned $104 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2022 (ended Sept. 24) alone. The company still has over $51 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term marketable securities on its balance sheet, and since it spent only $9.5 billion servicing its debts in fiscal 2022, it still has plenty of runway. Not to mention, Apple brought in $30 billion in net income (profit) in the recent first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31), so it's likely to continue piling up cash this year. Consumers love the company's portfolio of devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers, and its services including Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud, so it's likely to remain a financial powerhouse for years to come. Microsoft is in a similar position, though it has a different strategy from Apple in that it invests heavily in entering new industries to expand its footprint in the tech sector. Having started out in software with its Windows operating system, the company now operates one of the largest cloud services platforms in the world, it's a leader in the gaming industry, and it's becoming a front-runner in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. In fact, it recently committed to a multiyear investment deal with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which is rumored to be worth $10 billion. But Microsoft does have two things in common with Apple: Its cash position and its profitability. The company is sitting on $99.5 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments, and in the recent fiscal 2023 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), it generated $16.4 billion in net income. But a strong balance sheet alone won't always make for a great investment During what can only be described as a frenzy in the stock market during 2020 and 2021, many technology companies took advantage of their sky-high valuations to raise piles of cash from investors. As a result, they're sitting in a great financial position today even if their businesses aren't exactly performing well. Investment platform to Generation Z Robinhood Markets (HOOD 1.07%) is one example. It has over $6.3 billion in cash with no debt, yet investors have sent its stock price plunging 88% from its all-time high, valuing the company at just $8.4 billion as of this writing. That means they attribute only $2.1 billion of value to the business itself -- in other words, the cash on Robinhood's balance sheet is worth three times as much as the business it operates. When the pandemic era of government stimulus and ultralow interest rates ended in late 2021, Robinhood's young user base became less active in the financial markets. At the end of 2022, its monthly active user base had declined 46% from its peak in the year prior, coming in at 11.4 million. Similarly, the value of the cash and assets customers are holding with Robinhood is down 39% from its peak, to $62 billion. As a result, the company's quarterly revenue remained well below peak 2021 levels throughout last year. Investors typically don't want to own shares in a shrinking business. Therefore, Robinhood's incredibly strong balance sheet won't be enough to buoy its stock price in the long run, making it a difficult company to invest in.

Alphabet's Google unit plans to add artificial intelligence features to its search engine, the Wall Street Journal reported.Adding to recent data hinting at a weak labor market, initial jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ended April 1, versus expectations of 200,000 claims.The Labor Department's data from the prior week was revised to show 48,000 more applications were received.The S&P 500 climbed 0.36% to end the session at 4,105.02 points.The Nasdaq gained 0.76% to 12,087.96 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01% to 33,485.29 points.Wall Street has lost ground in recent days in response to signs of a slowing economy, including weak data on private payrolls and job openings earlier this week.That marked a change from recent months, when investors cheered weak economic data on the basis that it might mean the Fed's interest rate hikes were working and that the Fed could ease up on its campaign to rein in decades-high inflation.Interest rate futures imply traders are divided about whether the Fed will raise its target rate or keep it steady at its upcoming May meeting, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.""The market is trying to decide whether the 'growth and recession' scare or the 'Fed hiking' scare are more meaningful to prices, and so it's waffling between whether a softening labor market is good news because it gets the Fed to pause in May or bad news because it means the recession is actually coming,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.Investors are now focused on the more comprehensive report on non-farm payrolls, which are expected to have increased by 239,000 in March, down from the 311,000 jobs added in the prior month. That report is due on Friday, when the U.S. stock market will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.Traders work on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 31, 2023.

Here's Where I Start. By Stefon Walters – Apr 6, 2023 at 5:17AM Key Points Value investors look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. A company's P/E ratio tells you how much you're paying for each dollar of its earnings. To effectively use P/E ratios, you need to compare them with similar companies in the same industry. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOOGL Alphabet Market Cap $1,570B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.16%) $1.43 Current Price $125.07 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More With enough time and research, finding undervalued stocks can pay off big-time for investors. There are many different styles people take when approaching investing. One of those styles is value investing, which is looking for stocks trading below the price they're really worth. This can be as complicated as determining a stock's intrinsic value. For example, if a company is trading at $100 per share and an investor believes its intrinsic value is $125, they'd invest, hoping the stock market eventually prices it at $125 and they'll have 25% gains. But there are simple ways to use value investing principles, too. If you're looking to find undervalued stocks, look no further than a company's price-to-earnings ratio. Image source: Getty Images. Don't forget about the earnings The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is helpful because it tells you how much you're paying for each dollar of a company's earnings. You can find a company's P/E ratio by dividing its current stock price by its earnings per share (EPS). For example, if a stock is trading at $100 and has an EPS of $5, its P/E ratio would be 20, meaning you're paying $20 for each $1 of earnings. The P/E ratio alone won't tell you a stock's value, because different industries naturally have different P/E ratios. A large reason is that investors of companies in higher-growth industries are more willing to pay a higher price now for future growth. The banking industry, for example, typically operates with low P/E ratios, while healthcare is typically much higher. That's why you wouldn't compare JPMorgan Chase's P/E ratio to Johnson and Johnson's, or Apple's to Walt Disney's. You could, however, compare JPMorgan to Goldman Sachs, or Apple to Microsoft. If you're examining a company and its P/E ratio is noticeably lower than other companies in its industry, it could be undervalued -- for instance, if a company has a P/E ratio in the 10s but competitors are in the 20s or 30s. It's important to understand the reasons why that might be -- as we'll touch on in the next section -- but if you're looking for undervalued stocks, it's a reason to investigate. Understanding the why behind a company's P/E ratio Let's use Alphabet (GOOGL 1.16%) as an example. At recent prices, the company has a P/E ratio hovering around 23, less than half as much as just five years ago. That tells you the stock is cheaper than it's been in recent years. That doesn't necessarily make it undervalued. However, when you zoom out and compare it to other Big Tech peers, the argument can be made it's undervalued by comparison. DATA BY YCharts Since P/E ratios decrease when stock prices decrease, it's equally important to understand the why behind a stock's current levels. You want to ensure it's truly undervalued and not a justly priced bad investment. A glance at Alphabet's EPS history shows profit growth has slipped lately. But it's not the only one in that position, and its growth in recent years has still been strong. DATA BY YCharts Alphabet's slowing digital ad spending could be a reason why the market has soured. But an argument could be made that with macroeconomic conditions, it doesn't warrant the company losing more than 25% of its market value over the past year -- especially given its track record. What next? The P/E ratio isn't the final word on whether a stock is undervalued or not. But understanding what it's telling you about market sentiment is a good place to start your research. In the case of Alphabet, you might also ask: What could drive Alphabet's EPS growth higher in the future? Since the S&P 500's P/E is around 18 lately, will Alphabet grow so much faster that it deserves a higher multiple? Everyone likes a good value or discount, especially in the stock market. That's most of the appeal behind value investing. It does take time and research, but using a metric like the P/E ratio comparatively gives much more insight -- not only into a specific company, but also its competitors and the industry it operates in.

One FAANG component has a trio of operating segments poised to deliver significant growth in profits and cash flow. Meanwhile, sales and profits for another top-tier FAANG stock are stuck in reverse. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMZN Amazon.com Market Cap $1,299B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.10%) $1.39 Current Price $127.96 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Among Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google), there's one bargain-priced industry leader begging to be bought, as well as one outperformer that's now far too pricey. Things don't always go as planned when investing in the stock market. Even though the major U.S. indexes tend to rise in value over long periods, stock market corrections, crashes, and bear markets are a normal part of the long-term investing cycle. Over the past 15 months, volatility and uncertainty have picked up in a big way, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all falling into respective bear markets. But when the going gets tough on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to turn to long-term outperformers, such as the FAANG stocks. Image source: Getty Images. The FAANG stocks have run circles around Wall Street By FAANG, I'm referring to: Facebook, which is a subsidiary of Meta Platforms (META 1.09%) Apple (AAPL 1.56%) Amazon (AMZN 1.10%) Netflix (NFLX 1.49%) Google, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL 1.16%) (GOOG 0.92%) Over the trailing decade (as of March 31, 2023), the benchmark S&P 500 has returned a respectable 162%. By comparison, Netflix, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet (specifically the Class A shares, GOOGL) have respectively returned 1,180%, 942%, 729%, 675%, and 422% over the same time span. These stocks are running circles around Wall Street, which is why investors often flock to them when volatility picks up or a broader-market correction takes place. Another reason these stocks are beloved by investors is because they're industry leaders in one capacity or another. For example: Meta Platforms owns four of the most-popular social media sites in the world (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger). Apple's iPhone accounts for around half of all U.S. smartphone market share since 5G-capable versions went on sale in late 2020. Amazon's online marketplace was responsible for an estimated 39.5% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022, according to a report by eMarketer. Netflix is the global and domestic leader in streaming content market share. Alphabet's internet search engine Google accounted for more than 93% of worldwide search share in February 2023. But in spite of their long-term outperformance, not all FAANG stocks are created equal. In April, one FAANG stock stands out for being historically cheap, while another looks particularly pricey and should be avoided like the plague. The FAANG stock investors can buy hand over fist in April: Amazon Among the five FAANG stocks, the one that stands out as the best value in April is e-commerce kingpin Amazon. Like every single stock on the planet, Amazon has headwinds and risks it's contending with, the most prominent being the growing risk the U.S. economy will fall into a recession at some point in the not-too-distant future. Since a majority of Amazon's revenue is generated from retail sales, the inference is that the company could struggle if consumers pare back their discretionary spending. However, there's a pretty sizable flaw with using retail weakness as an excuse to avoid Amazon. Despite the online marketplace being Amazon's primary revenue driver, it doesn't play a particularly important role in cash-flow generation or operating income. Even if Amazon's e-commerce division sees sales reverse, the company's operating cash flow can sustain double-digit growth as long as a trio of ancillary operating segments continue to fire on all cylinders. Although Amazon's online marketplace isn't paramount to profits, the Prime memberships the marketplace helps lure certainly are. Two years ago, Amazon announced that it had surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers. As of the end of 2020, the company was generating $28 billion in annual run-rate sales from subscriptions. Since then, the price of a Prime membership has increased, and Amazon gained the rights to Thursday Night Football. Subscription services is now a $37 billion segment on an annual run-rate basis. In other words, the company's global Prime member count is likely well above 200 million. Advertising services is the second key segment for Amazon. While it's not in the same class as Alphabet or Meta when it comes to driving advertising revenue, Amazon is netting well over 2 billion visits on a monthly basis. That's more than enough of a dangling carrot to put ad-pricing power in Amazon's court. Despite the challenging growth environment in 2022, Amazon's ad services segment delivered quarterly year-over-year sales growth ranging between 21% and 30%, sans currency movements. The third ancillary division -- and the one that's arguably most important to Amazon's cash flow -- is Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS has gobbled up 32% of global cloud infrastructure service market share, which is excellent news considering enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings of growth. Best of all, AWS's exceptionally high margins provide anywhere from 50% to 100% of Amazon's annual operating income, even though AWS only accounts for about a sixth of the company's net sales. Based solely on the traditional price-to-earnings ratio, Amazon isn't much of a looker. But it doesn't make a lot of sense to use a traditional valuation metric to assess a company that reinvests the vast majority of its operating cash flow. Throughout the 2010s, investors willingly paid between 23 and 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. Investors buying shares of Amazon in April are paying approximately 13 times Wall Street's consensus cash flow for 2023 and just 7 forecast cash flow for 2026. On the basis of cash flow, Amazon stock is cheaper than it's ever been. Image source: Getty Images. The FAANG stock to avoid like the plague in April: Apple However, there are two sides to every coin. While tech stock Apple is a phenomenal business, it's this month's FAANG stock to avoid for a variety of reasons. Let's state the obvious: Apple isn't a train wreck. There's a reason it's Warren Buffett's top holding at Berkshire Hathaway and the largest publicly traded company by market cap in the United States. In calendar year 2022, Apple generated more than $109 billion in operating cash flow. Apple's capital-return program is also the envy of pretty much every publicly traded company. It's repurchased in excess of $550 billion worth of its common stock since the beginning of 2013 -- that's more than the market caps of all but seven S&P 500 companies, which includes Apple -- and is parsing out nearly $14.6 billion in dividends annually. In other words, if you're holding on to Apple for five or more years to come, there's a pretty good chance your initial investment will grow in value. But if you're looking for a market-topping return or a deal, don't expect to find it here. The allure of Apple has long been its supercharged growth prospects for a mega-cap company. Unfortunately, that's not what investors are getting right now. Mediocre sales following the launch of iPhone 14 coerced Apple to pull back on plans to expand production in September. Even though the company is strongly promoting fast-growing subscription services, physical products like the iPhone generate a majority of its sales. What makes the iPhone 14's so-so sales performance even more painful is that Apple has historically seen high inflation as a tailwind. Despite inflation pacing between 6% and 9% for much of the past year, Apple's full-year revenue for fiscal 2023 is expected to decline by 1%, according to Wall Street. To add fuel to the fire, Apple has relied on its mammoth share repurchase program to provide a boost to its earnings per share. Even with ongoing share buybacks, Apple's earnings per share is expected to decline by 2% in fiscal 2023. In short, none of the tools that have fueled Apple's outperformance in the past are on pace to help its top or bottom line grow in 2023. During bear markets, it's normal for investors to be more critical of company valuations. Following last week's strong performance for the broader market, Apple is commanding a multiple of 25 times forward-year earnings despite its lack of growth in the current fiscal year. Compare this figure to the multiple of 10 to 15 times forward-year earnings Apple consistently traded at from 2013 through 2018, and you'll see just how pricey Apple is in the current environment.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Wall Street Says 3 of Q1's Hottest Tech Stocks Are Done Rallying... at Least for Now By James Brumley – Apr 6, 2023 at 5:05AM Key Points The metaverse isn't quite living up to the hype voiced just a couple of years ago, raising questions about Roblox's growth potential. Now that EV newness has worn off and competition is creeping in, investors are rethinking Tesla's pricing paradigm. Spotify's adaptation and growth initiatives could prove slower, more complicated, and costlier than the market currently expects. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: RBLX Roblox Market Cap $24B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.67%) $0.26 Current Price $38.95 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More There are reasons most analysts are sticking with their previously established valuation calls. As the old adage goes, ""Past performance does not guarantee future results."" More to the point, there's no assurance that three of the first quarter's hottest technology stocks will be able to repeat the feat in the second quarter. Each ticker is near, at, or even beyond Wall Street's consensus target price (and it's not like analysts haven't had ample opportunity to raise their targets since these rallies began). Here's a closer look at these three names and their current situations. If you own any or all of them, it might be smart to reassess your reasons for holding these stocks. If they're a true long-term holding, so be it. If they're more of a trade, though, the trade's likely run its course. 1. Roblox Q1 gain: 58%Current price: $46.58Consensus price target: $39.40 The big gain dished out by metaverse outfit Roblox (RBLX 0.67%) shares since the end of 2022 makes enough sense on the surface. Last year was disastrous for the stock. The company went public at the height of 2021's metaverse mania, but as the COVID-19 pandemic eased and enthusiasm about the metaverse waned, so did investors' interest. The bear market certainly didn't help either. It's easy to look back and think the sellers overshot their target, though. The Q1 rally simply corrects that mistake. But there are still more questions than answers for Roblox. Chief among the questions are February's activity measures and their implications. By and large, they were solid. The number of daily active users grew 22% year over year, while the total number of hours spent playing within its virtual worlds improved 24%. The single-digit decline in the number of average sessions for daily users, however, could be a subtle early sign that its reach is peaking. Underscoring this idea is the fact that the same measure was essentially flat for January rather than up. Perhaps worse, this month's posting of these vital user metrics for March will be the company's last such report, obscuring a full view of the company's health at a time when Roblox should be demonstrating the importance of its role in the metaverse movement. Indeed, the decision could be interpreted as a deliberate move to obscure slowing growth stemming from weakening interest. NPD Group reports that sales of the virtual reality headsets needed to enter the metaverse actually fell 12% last year. Growing losses in spite of persistent revenue growth, and frequent misses of earnings estimates, are also becoming habits that ultimately work against the stock. 2. Tesla Q1 gain: 68%Current price: $191.64Consensus price target: $205.54 For the record, shares of electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (TSLA 1.45%) aren't quite to their consensus target of $205.54 just yet. They're close, sitting a mere 7% below that mark after failing to make any forward progress since mid-February's high. That may not be enough upside potential to justify the downside risk of this stock at this time. For years Elon Musk's Tesla was a company that could do no wrong, represented by a stock that rarely stayed down for long. As Tesla reached a massive scale and viable competition crept into the EV space, however, the stock's reliable bullishness and the bullish narrative surrounding the company suffered. Case in point: Despite a 44% year-over-year increase to 440,808 manufactured vehicles during Q1 and delivering a record-breaking 422,875 EVs in the same quarter, shares fell following the news. Why? Analysts were expecting deliveries of more than 430,000 battery-powered cars stemming from demand that was supposed to be spurred by price cuts. The modest inventory buildup further points to a possible slowdown in demand for Tesla's EVs. These worries are arguably overblown. After all, the Tesla name is nearly synonymous with electric vehicles, accounting for the majority of EV sales after Musk mainstreamed the EV movement. That's apt to remain the case for the indefinite future, too. True long-term investors can confidently step into or stick with the stock here. If you're only willing or able to hold Tesla shares as a near-term trade, there's above-average danger in doing so right now. This stock's increasingly being treated as a mature growth name rather than the must-have Wall Street darling it was during its earliest years of existence. This new dynamic is vexing investors, leaving shares vulnerable to volatility while the market gets a grip on this stock's new norm. 3. Spotify Technology Q1 gain: 69%Current price: $134.66Consensus price target: $136.44 Shares of Sweden's Spotify Technology (SPOT 0.82%) are rallying for understandable reasons. The digital radio platform passed 500 million listeners last month, and by leveraging AI-powered music suggestions along with short-form video and podcasts, the company believes it can grow its customer headcount to 1 billion by 2030. With the stock up nearly 70% just over the course of the past three months, though, the bulls have arguably gotten more than a little ahead of themselves. Don't misunderstand. A billion paying customers isn't an outrageous outlook in light of everything the app does and will eventually offer. Some analysts also argue the service is underpriced in certain markets (including in the U.S.), leaving room for a price increase that won't prompt a wave of cancellations. Guggenheim's Michael Morris is one of these analysts, upgrading SPOT stock to a buy last month to reflect ""our estimate of subscription plan price increases, which we expect will take effect on a broad geographic basis in mid-2023."" He adds that ""the music business gained scale and we see Spotify leadership continuing to recognize incremental efficiency as a value-creating strength that the company can disproportionally benefit from."" Translation? Look for losses to turn into profits as time marches on. The widening profit margins Morris believes are in the cards are a slow-moving train, reliant on business development initiatives that are still relatively foreign to Spotify in a market that includes stiff competition like Apple and Amazon. There's plenty of opportunity for stumbles and setbacks in the foreseeable future that could prompt a pullback. Conversely, there's not a lot of additional value left to pack into the stock's present price.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Why Apple Stock Was Down on Wednesday By Danny Vena – Apr 5, 2023 at 5:37PM Key Points A couple of analysts weighed in on the current trajectory of iPhone sales. These prognostications won't matter over the years and decades to come. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.29%) -$0.53 Current Price $183.26 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More iPhone sales may be slowing, but the news wasn't all bad. What happened Shares of Apple (AAPL -0.29%) traded lower on Wednesday, slipping as much as 2.3%. When the market closed for the day, the stock was still down 1.1% A broad cross section of stocks ended the day lower, which no doubt helped fuel Apple's decline. More pertinent to Apple investors, one analyst raised the specter of slowing iPhone sales in the face of tough macroeconomic conditions, while another was moderately more bullish. So what Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy dug deep on global web-traffic patterns and concluded that iPhone sales ""saw some deceleration"" during the month of February. As a result, the firm now believes sales likely ended the quarter in-line with expectations when they were previously ahead. More recent data suggests that average selling prices (ASPs) are higher than consensus estimates, according to the analyst, so Apple's revenue could still come in ahead of Wall Street's projections. The firm maintained its buy rating and $195 price target on the stock, which suggests potential gains for shareholders of 19% compared to Wednesday's closing price. At the same time, Bank of America (BofA) raised its price target on Apple to $168 from $158 and maintained a neutral rating on the shares. This suggests the analyst was playing catch up since Apple shares ended Tuesday at $165.63 -- above his previous call. After reading the tea leaves and checking sales channels, the firm believes the iPhones and services segments are ""stable to better,"" though Mac and iPad sales have suffered. He believes the combination will likely keep gross margins stable, and this stability ""modestly"" increases his expectations for the full year. Now what There's no question that Apple's success or failure rests mostly on iPhone sales, which represented 56% of the company's revenue in its fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 31. High inflation and economic uncertainty will almost certainly weigh on Apple's performance -- at least in the near term. Seasoned investors are keenly aware that ""this too shall pass."" By creating some of the most popular technology devices on the planet, it will certainly take more than a downturn to reverse Apple's long-term fortunes.

The rally still has more room to run, according to strategists at Deutsche Bank.  See: Are tech stocks becoming a haven again? ‘It’s a mistake,’ say market analysts. The tech-focused Nasdaq-100 index NDX, +0.59%, which tracks the top 100 nonfinancial companies listed on the Nasdaq Exchange including Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.21%, Meta Platforms Inc. META, +0.67%, Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.67% and NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, +1.21%, last week ended the month at its highest level since August, and advanced more than 18% for the quarter, according to Dow Jones Market Data. That compares with a 7% quarterly gain for the broader S&P 500 index SPX, +0.62% and a merely 0.4% increase for the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.61%. Tech-related stocks have rebounded after a brutal 2023 that saw them bear the brunt of a broad market selloff. “So far, the rally has largely reflected an unwinding of underweight positioning,” wrote strategists led by Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank’s chief U.S. equity and global strategist. “We see the next leg being driven by earnings beats and rising forward estimates on which there has been very little focus so far.” Chadha and his team said a pickup in global growth in the near-term and a peak in the U.S. dollar point to a sizable rebound in earnings growth for megacap growth and tech stocks.  “The top-down drivers of overall earnings as well as those for megacap growth and tech stocks have been upgraded significantly in recent weeks, with our economists raising their near-term forecasts for GDP growth in the U.S., Europe, China and Japan for a variety of different reasons, while the dollar has fallen significantly.” The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.52%, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, has dropped 1.5% year-to-date as of Wednesday.  Deutsche Bank’s forecasts see tech earnings rebounding off the bottom of the trend channel, returning to trend levels in Q1 and then growing in line through the rest of 2023 and 2024. (See chart below) SOURCE: BLOOMBERG FINANCE LP, DEUTSCHE BANK ASSET ALLOCATION Tech stocks outperformed massively in the first half of 2020 in the pandemic boom when the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates and pumped trillions of dollars into economies. Stocks then went sideways for the next 18 months, before underperforming in 2022 when the central bank started its aggressive interest-rate hikes to curb the inflation.  See: What tech bust? Big Tech stocks gained $2 trillion in roaring start to 2023 Consensus estimates for tech earnings in the first quarter of 2023 have risen 1% since early February, the first upgrade in a year, and in contrast with continued downgrades to all the other major indexes, said Chadha. Meanwhile, the upgrades also came notably after the bulk of the last earnings season was over. That’s unusual, as estimates are typically flat to down between earnings seasons, he wrote. “In the last three earnings seasons, analysts saw next-quarter estimates fall between 1.5% and 3% at this stage. Even after the upgrades, our estimates suggest a 3.5% beat for megacap growth and tech stocks in Q1. This would be the biggest since Q4 2021 and follow four quarters of weak beats or outright misses which occurred despite estimates being cut going into reporting,” they wrote. If the Deutsche Bank forecasts are correct, that could imply that forward estimates of next 12 months earnings, which had fallen through 2022, should inflect up and keep rolling higher for the rest of 2023, said Chadha. U.S. stocks finished mostly lower on Wednesday as investors weighed data on private-sector employment and the services sector. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.66% slumped 1.1%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Dow industrials gained 0.2%.

A bipartisan group of House lawmakers from the chamber’s Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party was expected to meet on Wednesday in Los Angeles with Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.03% CEO Bob Iger and other entertainment-industry leaders. On Thursday, the committee members are slated to meet in the Bay Area with Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.69% President Brad Smith, executives from Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.72% GOOGL, +0.69% and Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, +1.44%, and other tech-industry figures, and they are due to talk on Friday with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.20% CEO Tim Cook, according to multiple published reports. The chair of the select committee, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, has been taking a tough stance toward U.S. enterprises that do business in China.  Gallagher said in a radio interview in January that “Big Tech has to confront the growing suspicion about their allegiances” and referred to “greedy executives in Hollywood.” He also promised to have Iger and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver testify before his panel. This month, the congressman has been among the U.S. lawmakers highlighting security concerns over the technology in cargo cranes made by Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co. 600320, -0.55%, also known as ZPMC. Apple generates about 18% of its revenue from mainland China, according to FactSet data. For both Disney and Alphabet, China accounts for 4% of revenue; for Microsoft, it’s 12%; and for Palantir, it’s 7%. Both Democrats and Republicans appear increasingly eager to take a firm stand against Beijing. Signs of that came last month when TikTok’s CEO was grilled at a Capitol Hill hearing, as well as in January when the narrowly divided House voted overwhelmingly in favor of setting up the Select Committee on the CCP . “Congress, in our view, has determined that the status quo of U.S.-China relations is unacceptable, but lawmakers have yet to arrive at a shared legislative roadmap,” said Benjamin Salisbury, director of research at Height Capital Markets, in a note this week. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy met at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Wednesday. Tsai is on what is officially a stopover between Latin America and Taiwan. AFP via Getty Images “In that void, the Select Committee is likely to shape much of Congress’s rhetorical and legislative agenda,” he said. McCarthy, a California Republican, and Tsai made brief remarks on Wednesday at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., after their closed-door meeting, which was attended by members of the Select Committee on the CCP and other House lawmakers. “The friendship between the people of Taiwan and America is a matter of profound importance to the free world, and it is critical to maintain economic freedom, peace and regional stability,” McCarthy said. Taiwan is a self-governing island that is claimed by China. “It is no secret that today the peace that we have maintained and the democracy which we have worked hard to build are facing unprecedented challenges,” Tsai said. “We once again find ourselves in a world where democracy is under threat, and the urgency of keeping the beacon of freedom shining cannot be understated. President Reagan said it best: Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation,” she added.

Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner upgraded Meta’s stock META, +0.62% to buy from hold Tuesday, writing that “the cost cuts do demonstrate prudence by management and should improve profitability,” even though Meta continues to face challenges related to the advertising market and Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.21% privacy-related changes. Meta is in the process of making “some of the deepest cost cuts in the tech sector,” in Bonner’s view, as the company has announced two sizable rounds of layoffs. Beyond Twitter, which slashed more than half its staff as Elon Musk took over the company, Meta’s headcount reduction is “significantly greater than at most peers.” Besides the cost cuts, Meta has other factors working in its favor as well, Bonner wrote, especially as some of its competitors experience problems. TikTok faces pushback from the U.S. government, while Twitter “has made a series of erratic strategic moves” under Musk’s leadership “that have hobbled the company.” “We believe that challenges at TikTok and Twitter could benefit Meta, which continues to add users to its platform,” Bonner wrote, noting that “an outright ban of TikTok is by no means certain, any regulatory trouble for this disruptive upstart would be a positive for Meta.” Meta “is almost entirely dependent on advertising revenue,” Bonner noted, and like other social-media players, it’s tried to diversify a bit. One new initiative is a subscription program that lets creators and others verify their identities.  “It remains unclear whether the new service will provide significant new revenue, though any incremental revenue should be ‘found money’ for Meta,” he wrote. Bonner joins several other analysts who’ve turned bullish on Meta’s shares in the wake of recent cost-cutting moves. See more: Meta’s stock has more than doubled since November.

Reports of more OLED-based products from Apple and Samsung are good news for the company. The stock price had drifted 12.3% lower in the 52 weeks leading up to March, setting investors up for a sharp recovery. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: OLED Universal Display Market Cap $7B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.72%) $1.04 Current Price $145.82 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More No major news from Universal Display? No problem. Here's how this tech developer's stock surged 14% in March anyway. What happened Shares of Universal Display (OLED 0.72%) rose 14.2% in March, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The technology developer behind the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen you probably have on your phone nowadays didn't have much news of its own to report last month, but the stock was ready to rise on the slightest hint of good news from the mass-market smartphone and high-end TV-set markets. So what Entering March, the stock price had drifted 12.3% lower in 52 weeks. The shares weren't exactly bargain priced, trading at 10 times sales and 31 times adjusted earnings. However, every valuation ratio was dipping deeper than the stock price since Universal Display's sales and profits have been trending up over the last year. The company's financial performance has been stellar in recent years, despite last year's downturn in the all-important target markets of smartphones and OLED-based TV sets. OLED revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months. So the stock was looking for any excuse to release more of the market pressure after rising by 25.7% across January and February. As luck would have it, a couple of Universal Display's largest customers had some big news up their sleeves, related to OLED screens. First, the rumor mill churned out some OLED-based Apple (AAPL -0.29%) reports. The low-end iPhone SE 3 currently comes with a high-definition LCD screen, but Cupertino has reportedly ordered OLED screens from a Chinese supplier for the next iteration of this product line. At the other end of the product-pricing spectrum, Apple is said to have its first OLED iPad in the works with a planned price tag of $1,500 and up. For the record, the priciest iPad Pro base model today costs $1,099. On the TV side of the street, the only serious provider of living-room-scale OLED screens to date has been LG Display. So whether your high-end smart TV comes from LG, Sony, TCL, or Vizio, they all get their OLED screens from LG Display's panel-making factories. But that's about to change, as Samsung (SSNL.F) threw its hat into the TV-sized OLED manufacturing ring in mid-March. The larger Korean tech titan will offer a mid-priced range of OLED sets and also start reselling those screens to other TV builders. That's a big step forward in a key market. Now what Don't forget that Universal Display's patent royalties and OLED material sales are based on the total area of screens being sold, so one 55-inch TV screen is worth as much to this company as 100 5.5-inch smartphone screens. As a result, the unit volumes might be lower in this market than in the smartphone sector, but the company should enjoy a game-changing surge in sales and profits as OLED screens work their way toward affordable consumer prices and mass-market appeal. Universal Display has been one of my favorite high-growth tech stocks for years, and nothing has changed in that regard. The stock isn't cheap, but the company's long-term business prospects are downright thrilling. Anders Bylund has positions in Universal Display. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple. The Motley Fool recommends Universal Display. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research These Stocks Are Warren Buffett's 3 Largest AI-Fueled Investments By Will Healy – Apr 5, 2023 at 10:00AM Key Points Warren Buffett has offered mixed reviews of artificial intelligence. Berkshire Hathaway owns stock in numerous companies that heavily utilize AI. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.29%) -$0.53 Current Price $183.26 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Berkshire Hathaway's team invested in many ""AI stocks"" -- and not all of them are in the tech sector. Despite the recent optimism and hype surrounding stocks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), AI-focused investment strategies probably don't attract much interest from famed investor Warren Buffett -- at least, not directly. Buffett, who has spoken briefly about both the potential and the drawbacks of these technologies, would likely have less interest in being a direct AI investor. Emerging technologies tend to foster money-losing tech stocks, and history has usually proven him right when he was skeptical of such assets. However, many of the stocks Buffett already owns have made him and the Berkshire Hathaway team into AI investors by default, as many of his smaller investments -- stocks like Amazon, Activision Blizzard, and Snowflake -- make extensive use of the technology. Moreover, three of Berkshire's largest holdings make significant use of AI, and only one would fit the formal definition of a ""tech stock."" 1. Apple Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway did not buy Apple (AAPL -0.29%) for its AI-driven functionality, and AI is not a key reason that Apple now accounts for 44% of the value in the conglomerate's stock portfolio. Nonetheless, AI and ML play roles in enhancing virtually every current product and service offered by Apple. FaceID, voice recognition, and numerous apps are just some of the AI-driven features in its iPhone. Additionally, the company invested heavily in AI and ML research. It funds Apple Scholars, university students who conduct AI research. Also, its AIML Residency Program works with experts across several disciplines. These industry leaders build new AI and ML-driven products and services. While the results of its programs are difficult to predict, they will likely enhance Apple's influence and leadership in the AI industry. With the market's focus on AI increasing, Apple's stock is moving in the right direction. It has risen by more than 30% since the beginning of 2023. The increase in the stock price raised its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 28, making it an increasingly expensive company to buy. But as AI's influence over Apple's products and services grows, market-beating returns are probably still within reach for new investors. 2. Bank of America Its name may condition investors to see Bank of America (BAC -0.24%) as a bank, but given its heavy investments in technology, it has arguably evolved into more of a fintech stock. Those tech investments came amid its emergence from the 2008-09 financial crisis, and among the largest banks, it has become a fintech leader. Global Finance named it the ""Most Innovative Digital Bank"" in 2022. On the AI side, BofA describes Erica, its AI-driven assistant, as the engine that brings ""personalized banking"" to its clients. Erica delivers personalized insights and helps monitor accounts, identifying issues such as duplicate charges or changes in spending patterns. Understandably, the liquidity issues that caused the collapses of SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Capital's Silvergate Bank, and others have weighed on the banking sector. Despite BofA's stability, its stock price is down modestly since the beginning of the year. That price drop took its P/E ratio to 9, its lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic. Even though BofA makes up 9% of Berkshire's portfolio, the recent sell-off could be good news for Buffett and other investors. Since the industry's recent troubles do not affect Bank of America directly, now might be an opportune time to buy shares. 3. Chevron Chevron's (CVX 0.77%) growing AI capabilities are probably not prominent among the reasons why Buffett's team has continued to add to its large position in the energy giant. Nonetheless, Chevron accounts for 8% of the value in Berkshire's equity portfolio, and the technology will play at least an indirect role in boosting the value of the oil stock. Today's energy industry relies heavily on technology for various business activities. One area where AI in particular benefits Chevron is data management. To that end, it partnered with Microsoft and UiPath to automate data extraction into back-end systems. Because this process is now being handled automatically, Chevron's business analysts can spend more time on tasks that add more value. Additionally, Chevron applies AI to extract information from drilling reports. The technology can tell researchers how different types of rocks impact a hydrocarbon reservoir. These studies reduce the need to drill exploratory wells, reducing the environmental impact of Chevron's activities. Chevron's stock price is down for 2023, and due to that decline, its P/E ratio of around 9 is in the neighborhood of its multiyear low. Still, the recent announcement by several members of OPEC+ (a group of nations allied with OPEC to cut production in order to boost oil prices) that they will cut crude oil output next month has brought investors back to oil stocks, indicating the stock might soon be heading higher.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Apple Stock: Bear vs. Bull By Dani Cook – Apr 5, 2023 at 8:00AM Key Points Apple proved its strength in 2022 by outperforming many of its competitors. However, bears are increasingly concerned about the company's soon-to-be-released VR/AR headset. Success in digital services could mean the company still comes out on top. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.29%) -$0.53 Current Price $183.26 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The company could be headed toward disaster with an upcoming venture into an unproven market. Last year was tough for the tech industry, with countless stocks affected by a sell-off. Some of the world's most valuable companies were hit hard by steep rises in inflation, curbing consumer spending. However, the economically challenging year brought to light the strengths and weaknesses of many businesses. For instance, Apple (AAPL -0.29%) proved its resilience by outperforming many of its peers throughout 2022. Data by YCharts Apple amassed immense brand loyalty over the years thanks to the priority it places on quality and an interconnected product strategy, which promotes ease of use. As a result, its stock offers consistent gains over the long term. However, before investing in this tech giant, you'll want to be aware of both its pros and cons. Here's the bear vs. bull for Apple's stock. Bear: Potential roadblocks when entering a new market In January, Bloomberg reported Apple has plans to launch its first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset in 2023 after years of speculation. The new device is expected to feature VR and AR capabilities, presented with an iPhone-like interface, and cost around $3,000. However, Apple could face obstacles in succeeding in its new venture amid an uncertain time for the industry. VR has experienced a slight resurgence in recent years, boosted by Meta's Quest line of headsets and its push to grow what it calls the metaverse, or the next version of the internet. As a result, the Facebook owner achieved an 81% market in the VR and AR industry in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to Counterpoint Research. Despite Meta's efforts, however, the technology continues to have low adoption rates from consumers, with Microsoft and Disney recently shuttering their metaverse divisions after seeing a lack of engaging content. Apple has a long history of succeeding when entering new markets, proven by its leading 34.4% market share in headphones after releasing the first AirPods in 2016, despite the presence of established brands such as Bose and Sony. However, the VR/AR market is still in its infancy, with its future largely uncertain. Apple will have its work cut out for it to overcome Meta's dominance and convince consumers to embrace the technology. If any company could succeed in VR/AR, it would likely be Apple. However, if its coming headset doesn't pay off, a failed launch could be detrimental to its stock price. Bull: Apple has a swiftly expanding digital service business Despite potential trouble in its products, Apple's digital services business holds great promise. The company's current services library includes Apple TV+, Music, Fitness+, iCloud, and more, all accessible through a monthly subscription. In fiscal 2022, Apple's services segment earned the second-largest amount of revenue and reported growth of 14%, double the iPhone's 7%. Apple's expansion into digital services allows it to lean less on the success of its products, which can fluctuate quarter to quarter and are more prone to disruptions from economic conditions. Services also offer attractive profit margins, with the segment hitting 71.7% profitability in 2022 while physical products' margins were 36.3%. On March 30, Apple furthered its venture into services by launching its first buy now, pay later (BNPL) program in the U.S., taking on companies like Affirm and Klarna. Named Apple Pay Later, the new program will allow consumers to split purchases costing between $50 and $1,000 over six weeks. Apple Pay Later sees the company using its power in services to boost the sales of its product, which will likely attract more consumers who otherwise would have bought from the competition. Is Apple stock a buy? Apple shares soared 294% in the last five years and 977% in the last ten years. The company has built itself into a tech behemoth, amassing the largest market cap in the world and offering investors consistent gains over the long term. The company may face headwinds in the short term with its coming headset. However, with $20.54 billion in cash and equivalents as of Dec. 30, Apple has the funds and industry dominance to flourish in the long run. Meanwhile, its lucrative services business will likely continue boosting earnings for years. As a result, Apple's stock is a no-brainer buy right now.

In the midst of a banking crisis, historically high interest rates, geopolitical turmoil and heightened recession forecasts, the S&P 500 is up nearly 7% year-to-date. But investors should be wary, warn analysts, because the churn under the surface shows noticeable weakness. The rally that the S&P 500 has enjoyed since the beginning of the year has been driven by a small group of stocks — the market cap of the remaining 480 or so has basically remained the same. “This is not a broad-based rally where all stocks go up but instead a rally concentrated in a few of the largest stocks by market cap, mainly tech names,” Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, told CNN. Leading the way in growth are tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (FB). The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and stabilizing inflation rates have led to speculation that the Federal Reserve’s painful interest rate hikes could soon come to an end. That’s been a boon to large cap tech stocks that are more sensitive to interest rates because they tend to borrow more than established companies and rely more on the prospect of future earnings. But it also means that the current market rally is thin, as the major indexes outperform the average stock. Nvidia (NVDA), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), Visa (V), Exxon Mobil (XOM), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), Eli Lilly & Co (LLY), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) rounded out the list of stocks driving the vast majority of growth in the S&P 500. “The implication for investors is that this market is not driven by broad-based higher growth expectations but instead by what has happened with rates, in particular after [Silicon Valley Bank] went under,” said Slok. Strong outperformance from the largest stocks often power indexes to rise, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab, in a note Tuesday. But healthy markets should be characterized by greater participation of the “soldiers” — the rest of the stocks, she said. The flight to big tech is also a reaction to an increase in fear and uncertainty by traders, said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager from Brandywine Global. Market moves this year have come with a “huge undercurrent of skepticism,” Kaser told CNN. As the climate grows more unstable, investors are falling back on the large cap companies that they’ve come to rely on over the past few years. “In these initial stages of uncertainty people do tend to go back to what worked in the last cycle,” he said. “That’s not necessarily a guarantee that those stocks will continue to grow, but it is that comfort food they want to go back to, the Teslas and the other stocks that made easy money in the past.” The tech sector was a popular safe haven for traders during the height of the pandemic. In 2021, the combined yearly revenue of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook (now Meta) was $1.2 trillion — 25% higher than it was pre-Covid. The bottom line: The market looks really expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, said Kaser. “We’ve had this weird pause over the last three weeks where analysts haven’t been updating earnings estimates because of the banking turmoil. Those are undoubtedly going to come,” he said. “There’s currently a false sense of security that things won’t change, but a lot of the data under the surface is probably pointing towards higher odds of recession. This is not a favorable starting point for stocks as we think about the next few months.” The pound is back The British pound plunged to record lows last year as investors panicked about budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss, but just a few months later Truss is out of office and the pound is back. Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022, reports CNN’s Julia Horowitz. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is currently the best-performing currency among developed economies. So what sparked the rapid turnaround? The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3%, after dropping 0.5% in December. But it’s not all smooth sailing for Brits. This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns. Inflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach. ‘I am truly sorry.’ Credit Suisse chairman after bank meltdown Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann is sorry. The longtime bank executive spent his Tuesday making amends with angry shareholders after the ailing Swiss lender required an emergency rescue last month that left investors nursing heavy losses. “It is a sad day. For all of you, and for us,” Lehmann told 1,748 shareholders at an ice hockey stadium in Zurich at the bank’s last annual meeting as an independent company. CEO Ulrich Körner echoed these remarks, reports CNN’s Hanna Ziady. He said that he shared the disappointment of shareholders, clients, employees and the general public. “What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come,” he added. Demonstrators, meanwhile, gathered outside the venue, with some erecting a capsized boat to signify the bank’s demise. Still, Lehmann was narrowly re-elected as board chairman Tuesday. Shareholders also approved all other board directors standing for re-election.

Tech stocks were the key to the Dow being able to post any gain at all. Four tech stock winners were especially important and could keep rising.

Investors had hoped that the stock market would find its footing in 2023 after a tough showing last year. So far, the market has done a reasonably good job of delivering. With the first quarter having come to an end last Friday, major market benchmarks performed well, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.93%) seeing gains of 7% in the first three months of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hasn't held up as well, managing only to post a gain of less than 1% for the quarter. Yet when you look at the stocks that prevented the Dow from losing ground, you might be surprised to see that they all have one thing in common -- and that thing happens to be exactly what many investors thought would hold them back in 2023. The Dow's top stocks so far in 2023 The one surprising factor in the Dow's rise is that all four of the average's top-performing stocks are in the technology sector. Salesforce.com (CRM -0.75%), Apple (AAPL 1.56%), Intel (INTC 5.52%), and Microsoft (MSFT 1.55%) were the only Dow components to post gains of 20% or more in the first three months of the year. ^DJI data by YCharts The gains for all four of these stocks came amid signs that their respective businesses were resisting macroeconomic pressures better than many had expected. At the beginning of March, Salesforce released financial results that showed that it had seen revenue climb 18% in fiscal 2023, with adjusted earnings rising by 10% to $5.24 per share. Moreover, the customer relationship management software specialist projected that it would see accelerating profit growth in fiscal 2024, with guidance for $7.12 to $7.14 per share in earnings on an adjusted basis. For Apple, sizable gains came late in the period, as investors started to feel more confident about the company's prospects. Worries about the ability to overcome supply chain challenges kept the stock in check for a while, but stock analysts increasingly pointed to signs that demand for its core iPhone line of smartphones remained solid. Moreover, Apple has worked hard to keep costs reined in, and plans to join the virtual revolution with a mixed-reality headset have received a favorable reception. Perhaps the most surprising winner in this set of four was Intel, because the chipmaker has had a lot of trouble executing on its business opportunities. Yet there was new enthusiasm about the potential for Intel to provide vital semiconductors to innovative tech companies seeking to pursue artificial intelligence initiatives. Moreover, with data centers remaining a key component of digital transformation efforts for countless businesses worldwide, longer-term tailwinds for Intel remain in place. Now, Intel just has to take advantage of them. Lastly, Microsoft generated plenty of optimism on the AI front as well, with its key partnership with ChatGPT pioneer OpenAI producing meaningful potential. Combined with its core Office software and Azure cloud infrastructure businesses, Microsoft has put itself in position to capture plenty of growth from some of the most cutting-edge ideas in technology, and it's showing signs of pulling away from some of its oldest rivals in the software arena. Keep watching tech Many market watchers were surprised to see tech climb even as interest rates continued to move higher. Yet with stress in the financial system, investors saw some of these blue chip tech stocks as safe havens, with reliable business performance plus the possibility of future growth. In a tough market environment, such sentiment could help push the Dow still higher in the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. Dan Caplinger has positions in Apple and Microsoft. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple, Microsoft, and Salesforce. The Motley Fool recommends Intel and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel and long January 2025 $45 calls on Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

[+] European Union (EU) flag on a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Apple stock had a solid year so far rising by about 27% since early January, outperforming the Nasdaq-100 which remains up by about 20% year-to-date. Now, tech stocks in general have fared well this year, following a tough 2022, as cooling inflation and a slowing pace of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led investors back to the beaten-down sector. Some other factors have likely helped Apple AAPL stock recently. Apple is making deeper inroads into the financial services space, recently launching a “buy now, pay later” offering that enables Apple Pay users to split payments for purchases over several weeks without incurring interest or fees. Investors are looking ahead to potential new product launches from Apple. Apple is poised to launch a new mixed-reality headset sometime this year. Although the device is likely to be expensive, with volumes expected to be limited at launch, it would mark Apple’s first all-new product launch in almost seven years. The device could also give investors a sense of the company’s plans for computing beyond the smartphone and PC era. Moreover, Apple’s next-generation iPhone due this fall, presumably called the iPhone 15, is likely to feature more pronounced updates. There are expectations that Apple will raise prices on the flagship variants of the device, after essentially keeping prices flat for six years. So, is Apple stock still a buy following the big rally this year? We believe Apple stock is now fully priced. At the current market price of roughly $165 per share, Apple trades at almost 28x consensus FY’23 earnings, which we believe is a relatively high valuation for the company. Apple’s current earnings yields and its position as a safe-haven stock are looking less attractive, with the Federal funds rate standing at between 4.75% to 5.00% presently. Moreover, we have concerns regarding the slowdown in Apple’s services business after years of robust growth. Services revenue grew by just just 6.4% in Q1 FY’23, compared to an average growth rate of over 20% each year over the last five years. This is negative for Apple, considering that services are typically Apple’s highest margin segment (over 70% gross margins compared to about 36% for hardware). We value Apple stock at about $160 per share, marginally below the current market price.

11:04 AM |  9 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Tuesday Market Open) Despite all the geopolitical, banking, and inflation fears, major U.S. indexes continue to climb and entered Tuesday on a four-day winning streak. In many cases, the worst hasn’t come to pass, so fear has slowly leached out of the market, perhaps raising appetites for risk assets.A quiet overnight session brought small gains despite the price of crude oil continuing its ascent following OPEC’s surprise production cut announcement. Crude spiked early yesterday but hasn’t extended those gains too much, and the decision caused some head-scratching ahead of what many analysts expect to be rising demand from China as it reopens.Energy shares led the way Monday as Wall Street began the week on a green note, and many overseas markets followed suit earlier Tuesday. Focus today is likely to be on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data due soon after the open (more below).We’re a few days into Q2 and there’s still a buzz over the S&P 500® index’s (SPX) Q1 strength. It rose 7% in the quarter, and analysts were quick to point out Monday that, in past years when the SPX climbed in Q1 following losses the year before, it ended up extending the positive trend.Something to keep in mind, though, is that much of the SPX’s gains in Q1 came courtesy of a handful of very large stocks that can have outsized influence on the index due to their heavy weighting. As Schwab Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders notes in her latest commentary, the 10 largest stocks in the SPX were responsible for 90% of the index’s Q1 increase, with the triumvirate of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) contributing more than 50%.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) rose 3 basis points to 3.46%. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) slipped to 102.02. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures edged up to 18.82. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) rose to $81.14 per barrel. Volatility popped a bit early yesterday as crude prices soared on news of OPEC’s production cut, but VIX didn’t make it to 20. VIX remains near the March lows, hinting that traders don’t expect dramatic moves in stocks anytime soon.Just InPerhaps OPEC knows what it’s doing. That could be the takeaway when you consider the cartel’s surprise cut to crude production over the weekend preceded Monday data releases showing continued struggles for two of the world’s key economies. Both U.S. and China manufacturing activity came in below expectations in separate reports, reinforcing ideas that slowing demand for manufactured goods conceivably could lower crude oil demand, as well.The March Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.0, right on the cusp of levels that would indicate retraction, and below the consensus view collected by Trading Economics. This raises new questions about how quickly China’s recovering from COVID-19 shutdowns.Then the U.S. March Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Index fell to 46.3, the lowest since May 2020. Deeper in the report, drops in new orders and prices signaled more weakness, with almost every component declining in March from February’s readings. This is the fifth straight month of declining U.S. manufacturing activity, providing more ammunition to analysts predicting a recession.How did the stock and Treasury markets react to yesterday’s soft U.S. manufacturing data? By jumping quickly to intraday highs, though stocks quickly gave back their gains. The “bad news is good news” hypothesis still appears to hold water, with investors hoping weak data means less pressure on the Fed to continue tightening. The 2-year Treasury yield—generally seen as quite sensitive to interest rates—fell below 4% right around the time the ISM data hit the tape.Today’s job openings data could provide more clues for the Treasury markets. Any sign of tightening (fewer job openings) would probably help ease inflation concerns even more, possibly underpinning Treasury note values and lowering yields (which move opposite of the underlying note). That report is due at 10 a.m. ET.Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS): The latest update comes right after the market opens today. This report’s been swollen for months, hovering close to 11 million. However, the headline number fell by 400,000 in January to 10.8 million. Analysts expect another drop, albeit to a level that’s still historically high near 10.4 million, according to Trading Economics.Stocks in SpotlightJP Morgan Chase’s (JPM) influential CEO Jamie Dimon said in a letter to shareholders today that while the current U.S. banking crisis is “nothing like 2008,” it isn’t clear when the crisis will end. He thinks it could bring tighter financial conditions as banks get more conservative, but isn’t sure if that will have an impact on consumer spending.Walmart’s (WMT) investor meeting runs today and tomorrow, putting the focus on any observations company executives have about their current fiscal quarter after they offered soft guidance back in February. Back then, the company said high prices and weak demand for discretionary items were potential headwinds. Other retailers like Home Depot (HD) concurred in their own earnings reports at the time.One thing in WMT’s favor, however, could be a dynamic where shoppers gravitate toward lower-cost retailers when economic growth slows. Perhaps the company can shed light on whether this is happening, which might offer investors a sense of general consumer sentiment.Fries with that? If people are trying to save money, you’d think that would help a fast-food outlet like McDonald’s (MCD). Investors seem to think so, anyway, as shares of MCD went on a roll (or should we say a bun) in late March. Now the company is preparing corporate layoffs, according to the Wall Street Journal, though MCD won’t say how many people will receive pink slips. MCD reduced its headcount by about 30,000 between 2017 and 2019, the paper reported. Generally, most recent layoff announcements have been in the tech sector. The question now is whether MCD is the tip of the iceberg for retail sector layoffs.Eye on the FedRecent data, including yesterday’s ISM manufacturing and last Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices both came in below expectations, but this doesn’t necessarily mean the Fed is much less likely to raise rates next month. The next meeting is four weeks away, and a lot can happen between now and then. For a pause to start looking more feasible, we’d probably need to see data that doesn’t simply fall short of expectations. It likely needs to be significantly below expectations, considering the Fed’s focus on fighting inflation. Rising gas prices in the wake of the OPEC oil production cut could simply make the Fed even more wary of any data that suggest more price pressure. Market participants seem aware of this, as the futures market continues to price in better than 60% probability of a 25-basis-point hike in early May, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, despite recent signs of slowness in the data. One wildcard: Layoffs. These aren’t in the realm of “data” per se but can come at any time. Eventually, layoffs do show up in the data, typically in the form of new jobless claims. That number has been very low almost all year, but if layoffs pick up, we could see that change—and the Fed is likely to take notice. What to WatchJobs update: A few days out from the March Nonfarm Payrolls report, here’s how analyst estimates shape up, according to Trading Economics: Jobs growth: 240,000, down from 311,000 in February but still historically high. Hourly wage growth: 0.3%, up from 0.2% in February. Unemployment rate: 3.6%, unchanged from February. Participation rate: 62.5%, unchanged from February. If participation rises, that would likely be read as a positive sign of a tightening labor market that could help cool inflation. It inched up in February and the unemployment rate rose slightly. That may seem contradictory, but the Labor Department doesn’t count non-participants in the job market—those who are neither working nor looking for work—when it calculates the headline unemployment rate.Out of Breadth: Just 10 large stocks accounted for most of the SPX’s gains in Q1. This isn’t the kind of broad and deep rally that bullish investors like to see. For more insight on Q1 performance, check the most recent update from Schwab chief investment strategist Liz Ann Sonders and senior investment strategist Kevin Gordon.https://tickertapecdn.tdameritrade.com/assets/images/pages/md/chart-4-4.png 800w"" media=""(min-width: 36em)"" sizes=""(min-width: 36em) 33.3vw, 100vw"" />https://tickertapecdn.tdameritrade.com/assets/images/pages/xs/chart-4-4.png 2x"" /> CHART OF THE DAY: TALE OF TWO QUARTERS: The SPX Sector Select Technology Index (IXT—candlesticks) had a very different kind of quarter than the SPX Sector Select Financials Index (IXM—purple line), as tech easily outpaced financials by the largest margin since Q1 of 2009.

Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investWhat drove crude cut? OPEC’s decision to trim crude production by more than 1 million barrels per day over the weekend surprised the market, but recent price action should probably have provided clues. Many of the largest members of the cartel find it hard to profit at prices below $80 per barrel, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), so the recent dive to near $70 for Brent crude—a 15-month low—probably raised profitability concerns.Less competition: In the past, OPEC was sometimes hesitant to cut production too much, fearing the resulting higher prices might cause U.S. producers to increase their own output and flood the market. That doesn’t seem to be the case these days, as U.S. production remains about half a million barrels per day below the 2019 peak of 13 million, and many major oil companies have expressed hesitance to drill more, according to a survey last year by the Dallas Fed. The recent banking issues could make U.S. crude even less of a concern for OPEC, causing problems for smaller U.S. oil producers trying to finance increased production.Recession clue? The final straw for OPEC might have been last month’s U.S. and European banking industry issues, which economists say raised demand concerns. OPEC doesn’t want to pump crude if it’s not going to be immediately used, perhaps still haunted by images of oil barges at sea with nowhere to go in the spring of 2020, when front-month U.S. crude futures briefly fell below zero during the pandemic. In a sense, the weekend production cut is another bet, this time by OPEC, on the global economy slowing down.CalendarApril 5: February Trade Balance and March ISM Non-Manufacturing Index.

By Rob Starks Jr – Apr 4, 2023 at 7:00AM Key Points Investors worry about the company's revenue growth and increasing competition in this weak economic environment. PayPal's profits should recover once e-commerce growth resumes. Its valuation is near its lowest since the company separated from eBay. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: PYPL PayPal Market Cap $71B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.14%) $0.09 Current Price $63.82 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:31 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Investors have lost enthusiasm for investing in this money transfer company over the last year and a half. PayPal (PYPL 0.14%) started the year by rising 24% to an intraday high of $88.63 on Feb. 2, as many optimistic investors believed the Federal Reserve was close to ending its relentless rate hikes and the economy could achieve a soft landing -- an excellent scenario for this business. However, investors lost interest in the company after subsequent events showed the chances were high the economy would instead have a hard landing, a sharp economic slowdown. As a result, investors worry about a further deterioration in PayPal's revenue growth. Now that today's stock price is closer to where it started the year, should you use the pullback in the stock's price to buy, or should you sit on the sidelines and wait until the danger of recession has passed? Let's take a look at that question. The top dog in e-commerce payments PayPal started in 1998 and was among the first to market payment services between merchants and consumers in the then-emerging e-commerce industry. Thus, it established strong brand recognition and customer loyalty well before significant competition appeared. Additionally, because it operates on both sides of the payment transaction, it enjoys a two-sided network effect. The value the consumer gains from using its network is determined by how many merchants accept payments from PayPal. Conversely, the number of consumers who use the payment service determines the platform's worth for merchants. Thus, the value of the payment platform increases with each new consumer or merchant joining the network. PayPal used these two competitive advantages to increase its total payment volume through its platform to $1.36 trillion in fiscal 2022 -- making it a powerful global payments platform. As of September 2022, PayPal is the No. 1 player in the online payments industry, with a market share of about 42%, according to market research company Statista. Considering the company's dominance in online payments, it makes you wonder why investors have abandoned the stock over the past 18 months or so. A poor economic environment and increased competition Growth investors familiar with seeing the company producing double-digit percentage revenue growth started aggressively selling their shares in late 2021 into 2022 as revenue growth began its steep fall into the single digits, as shown in the following chart. PYPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Data source: YCharts Quarterly reports over the past year have not helped investors feel better about the company. For instance, its fourth-quarter 2022 results continued to show several deteriorating key metrics, despite the headlines of revenue and earnings beating analysts' expectations. For example, the growth of active accounts, defined as registered PayPal accounts that completed a transaction over its network within the last 12 months, slowed to a crawl, showing only 2% growth compared to the previous year's 13% year-over-year growth. In addition, TPV showed a sharp deceleration from 23% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 to a measly 5% in the fourth quarter of 2022 -- yikes! No wonder revenue growth fell off a cliff. Management has blamed the deterioration of active accounts, TPV, and revenue on multiple factors, including a weaker macro economy and slowing e-commerce growth. Investors have also recently been displeased with the company's operating margins, thinking a savvy management team and its competitive advantages would build a moat around PayPal's profitability. Yet, operating margins began deteriorating starting in July 2021, as seen in the chart below (though they've rebounded some in the past few quarters). PYPL Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts Many believe PayPal's deteriorating fundamentals have causes beyond just a cyclical downturn. The company's competitive advantages may have eroded, resulting in it spending more to stave off its adversaries, which decreases operating margins. On the merchant side, PayPal faces competition from companies like Stripe, and on the consumer side, platforms like Apple Pay are chipping away at its payment dominance. Shareholders also worry about Block competing on both sides of the payment transaction, with Square on the merchant side and Cash App on the consumer side. Why you should put PayPal on your buy list Despite the competition, PayPal is still the lead dog and a preferred only payments partner. Revenue growth probably will recover once e-commerce growth rebounds -- but when that occurs is anyone's guess. The good news is that this management team has focused on things it can control, which is cutting costs in areas not producing enough bang for the buck while fully staffing and funding the most productive areas of the company to pursue profitable growth. PayPal is already seeing progress in its cost-cutting initiatives, resulting in its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) operating margin widen by 115 basis points year over year to 22.9%, up sequentially for two straight quarters. Meanwhile, it continues to invest in its most-promising growth initiatives like the modernization of the checkout experience; scaling growth at Braintree, a PayPal-owned payments processor; and fully ramping up its unbranded service to small and mid-sized businesses. The unbranded service is its checkout technology that appears on a third-party merchant's website without displaying the PayPal button. PayPal today trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.12, hovering near its lowest valuation since its separation from eBay in 2015. Suppose you believe PayPal's revenue growth will bounce back to double digits percentages once the global economy improves and e-commerce growth rebounds. Through continued cost control, the company should achieve solid margins and increase profits rapidly, making today's valuation look mighty tempting to an investor. And it would be a great time to grab a few shares of this undervalued stock. Rob Starks Jr has positions in Block. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple, Block, and PayPal.

It currently produces a relatively small amount of revenue and huge operating losses. Most of those operating expenses aren't going toward existing products, though. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: META Meta Platforms Market Cap $695B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.09%) $2.95 Current Price $274.00 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Investors should expect another big year of metaverse-related investment in 2023. Meta Platforms (META 1.09%) has invested tens of billions into developing virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technology without much to show for it in terms of a viable new business segment. That could start to change next year. While management plans to continue its outsized investments in the Reality Labs segment, management plans to keep investments in line with overall revenue growth starting in 2024 and beyond. ""We expect to pace Reality Labs investments to ensure that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in October. An indication of improving profitability in Reality Labs could give investors confidence that Zuckerberg's massive bet will finally pay off. Meta reported big costs, little revenue Reality Labs is currently generating massive operating losses with inconsistent revenue. Meta had a hit with the Oculus Quest 2, but sales dropped in 2023. Image source: The Motley Fool. Data source: Meta Platforms. The fourth-quarter revenue decline indicates the market for virtual reality headsets remains relatively limited. Meta and other companies in the VR/AR space have work to do in order to expand the market. That could come with a new wave of product announcements in the near future from several companies, including Apple (AAPL 1.56%). Apple is reportedly developing its own AR/VR headset with a potential release later this year. Apple's entry into a category has historically given the entire industry a boost. The meager revenue from the segment barely makes a dent in Meta's operating expenses. Reality Labs produced operating losses of $13.7 billion and $10.2 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net effect on operating margin for 2022 was nearly 12.5 percentage points. What's driving those massive losses? The biggest thing driving losses in Reality Labs is Meta's investments in augmented reality technology. There are three areas of investment within Reality Labs: Virtual reality products like its Oculus lineup, metaverse software development like Horizon Worlds, and augmented reality technology, none of which has shipped. In fact, Zuckerberg says augmented reality research and development is the biggest expense in the segment. Indeed, augmented reality could be a much bigger market than virtual reality. The potential for technology to overlay information in the real world (AR) is much more appealing for many than immersing yourself in a separate virtual world (VR). There are likely many more uses, too. VR may be just a stepping stone to AR. To that end, Meta's spending on Reality Labs isn't going to slow down. ""We're going to continue to invest meaningfully in this area given the significant long-term opportunities that we see. It is a long-duration investment,"" CFO Susan Li said on Meta's Q4 earnings call. Managing for operating profit growth There are two ways Meta can improve operating profits while increasing its investments in AR research and the rest of Reality Labs: Reaccelerate growth in the advertising business, or start producing meaningful revenue from the Reality Labs segment. The former is very likely going to happen. Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence to overcome the challenges it faces in tracking ad performance following Apple's introduction of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14. It's showing improvements in Reels monetization as well, which has become a significant source of ad inventory, displacing some higher-value inventory in Feed and Stories. The outlook for the ads business is very positive. The latter, however, remains a real possibility. As Meta brings its AR technology to market through smartphone and headset devices, it should be able to make headway in expanding the market and producing real revenue within the segment. 2024 will be the year to watch to see improvements in profitability for Reality Labs. In the meantime, patient investors should be rewarded as the advertising business rebounds, making Meta shares a great way to invest in the potential of augmented reality.

Comparing the historical outlook and ongoing trends of this market The Global IoT in Healthcare Market is expected to garner significant returns over the assessment timeline of 2022-2029. The breakout of the Coronavirus pandemic created profitable prospects for this business vertical. Increasing infection rates led to a rapid rise in the patient pool, which in turn created a massive shortage of healthcare equipment as well as professionals to ensure the effective treatment of all the patients. Apart from that, patients suffering from other ailments were reluctant to visit healthcare centres due to contamination risks. This increased the adoption of IoT based healthcare devices which could facilitate remote health consulting and other activities. IoT technologies further enabled healthcare professionals to constantly monitor a patient's health status remotely. These factors together stimulated the dynamics of this industry sphere during the pandemic era. Increasing health awareness among the masses is another crucial development stimulant for this market sphere. This has been a growing trend of self-health management wherein individuals are keen about monitoring their health and take efficient preventive measures in case of any abnormalities. It is impossible for people to physically visit healthcare centers frequently to monitor their health. This has given rise to the popularity of remote health monitoring devices including wearables. With the help of these devices and technologies people can easily monitor their health based on various parameters. This in turn is adding traction to the overall growth of this industry vertically.
