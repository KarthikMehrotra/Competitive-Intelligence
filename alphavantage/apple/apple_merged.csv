increase in smartphone penetration - Technavio News provided by Technavio 07 Apr, 2023, 21:00 ET Share this article Share this article NEW YORK, April 7, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The mobile value-added services (VAS) market is set to grow by USD 723.25 billion from 2022 to 2027 progressing at a CAGR of 15.76% during the forecast period. The report offers an up-to-date analysis regarding the current global market scenario, the latest trends and drivers, and the overall market environment. The market is driven by the rapid increase in smartphone penetration. Consumers are increasingly using their mobile devices for a variety of purposes, from gaming and web browsing to e-commerce and social media interactions. Moreover, mobile phone manufacturers also offer a wide range of smartphone deals at competitive prices, and consumers can choose smartphones that meet their specific needs. Smartphone penetration will continue to grow, especially in emerging markets such as India and China, due to improvements in internet speed and technological infrastructure. This is anticipated to drive the mobile communications market (VAS) during the forecast period. Here is an exclusive report about market scenarios with a historical period (2017-2021) and forecast period (2023-2027). Download a Sample Report! Continue Reading Technavio has announced its latest market research report titled Global Mobile Value-added Services Market 2023-2027 The mobile value-added services (VAS) market covers the following areas: Mobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market SizingMobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market ForecastMobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market Analysis Mobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market 2023-2027 - Market Dynamics Trend: The increasing popularity of AR in location-based games is another major factor supporting the mobile value-added services (VAS) market growth. The adoption of AR in location-based games, where virtual content is layered over real-world surroundings and objects, is increasing. The growth in popularity of AR in location-based games can be attributed primarily to platform flexibility. The growing trend of game offerings that merge AR with LBS is expected to attract significant investment from key mobile VAS providers such as Alphabet and Apple. This, in turn, will drive the mobile games segment, thereby fueling the growth of the global mobile value-added services (VAS) market. Challenge: The constraints in content monetization will be a major challenge for the mobile value-added services (VAS) market. Traditionally, the major revenue share for mobile service providers was generated from voice calls. However, owing to the rapid reduction in call tariffs and the advent of popular online calling applications and IM services, which provide free voice and video calling services, the revenue generated from voice calls has declined drastically. Hence, monetizing content to substitute voice call revenue is expected to hinder the growth of the global mobile value-added services (VAS) market.Mobile Value-added Services (VAS) Market 2023-2027: Market SegmentationThe report offers an up-to-date analysis regarding the current global market scenario, the latest trends and drivers, and the overall market environment. The market is segmented by product (mobile advertising, mobile games, mobile music and video streaming, mobile money and m-commerce, and mobile publications), end-user (large enterprises, small, and medium enterprises), and geography (APAC, North America, Europe, South America, and Middle East and Africa).The market growth will be significant in the mobile advertising segment during the forecast period. With the rapid adoption of mobile broadband, video advertising offers consumers an attractive format in a non-intrusive manner. These ads are typically placed in over-the-top (OTT) applications and social media platforms, with consumer clicks and application installs being key parameters for measuring advertiser revenue generation. Certain developing markets such as Africa and South America still depend primarily on SMS and MMS advertising, though the growth of mobile broadband in these markets will see a shift toward mobile internet-based advertising during the forecast period. This report presents a detailed picture of the market by the way of study, synthesis, and summation of data from multiple sources through an analysis of key parameters - View a Sample ReportCompanies MentionedThe global mobile VAS market is highly competitive, with the presence of many international and domestic vendors. Many new players are entering the market, especially in emerging markets, as the rapid adoption of smartphones and the high penetration of mobile broadband services are increasing the demand for mobile VAS among consumers. However, major international players have a competitive advantage due to higher investment opportunities and diversified product portfolios, which will help them compete during the forecast period.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Is Lumentum Stock a Buy Now? By Leo Sun – Apr 7, 2023 at 9:59AM Key Points Lumentum’s stock tumbled after the company released its Q2 earnings report. Its cyclical challenges, competitive threats, and customer concentration issues are difficult to overlook. Its stock deserves to trade at a discount to its industry peers. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: LITE Lumentum Market Cap $4B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.70%) $0.91 Current Price $54.20 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The optical chip and laser manufacturer faces a lot of near-term headwinds. Lumentum's (LITE 1.70%) stock plunged nearly 10% on April 6 after the producer of optical chips and lasers posted its latest earnings report. For the second quarter of fiscal 2023, which ended on Dec. 31, its revenue rose 13% year over year to $506 million but missed analysts' expectations by $1 million. Its adjusted net income dropped 13% to $104 million, or $1.52 per share, but still cleared the consensus forecast by $0.20. Lumentum's growth rates were lumpy, but its stock had already been cut in half over the past 12 months and trades at just 9 times forward earnings. Should investors take the contrarian view and buy this beaten-down tech stock? Image source: Getty Images. A cyclical stock with customer concentration issues Lumentum generated 89% of its revenue from its optical communications chips in the second quarter. This segment produces optical chips for service providers, as well as 3D-sensing chips for mobile devices, cars, 3D printers, and other industrial machines. The remaining 11% came from its sales of commercial manufacturing lasers. Lumentum's largest customers are Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Ciena (NYSE: CIEN), which accounted for 29% and 13% of its revenue, respectively, in fiscal 2022. Lumentum's 3D-sensing chips and lasers power Apple's Face ID features, but TF International Securities analyst Ming Chi-Kuo believes Apple plans to replace Lumentum's lasers with Sony's (NYSE: SONY) in the iPhone 15 Pro. Kuo claims that loss could represent a ""long-term structural risk"" to Lumentum's business. Lumentum's dependence on Ciena has also raises red flags. In a statement issued with its second-quarter report, Lumentum CEO Alan Lowe said ""a network equipment manufacturer who represented more than 10% of our fiscal second quarter revenue"" (most likely Ciena) ""would not take the shipments we had originally projected"" due to inventory management issues. Those customer concentration issues and the broader macro headwinds caused many investors to shun Lumentum. Inorganic growth with declining margins Lumentum's top-line growth accelerated over the past year, but most of that growth came from its acquisition of NeoPhotonics last August. It claimed that acquisition would generate $50 million in synergies over the following two years, but component shortages and the integration of NeoPhotonics' lower-margin optoelectronic products (which are used to transmit optical signals) still reduced its adjusted gross and operating margins over the past year. Metric Q2 2022 Q3 2022 Q4 2022 Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Revenue Growth (YOY) 6.7% (5.7%) 7.7% 13% 13.3% Adjusted Gross Margin 51% 49.5% 50.4% 48.2% 44.9% Adjusted Operating Margin 31.7% 26.5% 28.8% 27.1% 23.1% Data source: Lumentum. YOY = Year-over-year. Therefore, Lumentum's revenue growth will likely decelerate after it laps its acquisition of NeoPhotonics, while the component shortages and macro headwinds could continue to squeeze its margins. Its outlook for the third quarter backed that bearish view. It expects its revenue to only rise 9% to 16% year over year, mainly due to its unexpected loss of Ciena's orders, compared to analysts' expectations for 19% growth. And even though it's reining in its spending, it still expects its adjusted operating margin to contract to 17% to 19%. For the full year, Lumentum expects its revenue to come in at the low end of its prior guidance for 12% to 20% growth as its adjusted EPS declines 10% to 15%. Analysts currently expect its revenue to increase 11% as its adjusted EPS slides 12%. For fiscal 2024, they expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to both grow by about 4%. There aren't any compelling reasons to buy Lumentum Lumentum's valuation could limit its downside potential, but its cyclical headwinds, competitive challenges, and customer concentration issues are impossible to overlook. There are also plenty of better diversified tech stocks that are still on sale as the bear market drags on, so I can't recommend buying Lumentum right now. Leo Sun has positions in Apple.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research These 2 Stocks Make Up 53% of Warren Buffett's $342 Billion Portfolio By Sean Williams – Apr 7, 2023 at 5:06AM Key Points The Oracle of Omaha has vastly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 since he became CEO of Berkshire Hathaway in the mid-1960s. Berkshire's $342 billion portfolio owns stakes in 49 securities, but more than $180 billion of invested assets are tied up in just two stocks. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Portfolio concentration is the unsung hero of Berkshire Hathaway's long-term success. Few people garner attention from everyday and professional investors quite like Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.36%) (BRK.B -0.50%) CEO Warren Buffett. Despite being fallible like every other investor, the Oracle of Omaha has outpaced the total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 by a factor of 153 since becoming CEO in the mid-1960s -- a 3,787,464% return for Berkshire's Class A shares (BRK.A), versus 24,708% for the S&P 500, as of Dec. 31, 2022. Buffett's not-so-subtle secrets to success are aplenty. He has a relatively narrow research focus, tends to buy profitable, dividend-paying, time-tested businesses, and prefers to hold those positions for long periods. But the factor that might be most responsible for Berkshire Hathaway's outperformance is portfolio concentration. Buffett has long believed that diversification is only necessary if you don't know what you're doing. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool. As of the closing bell on April 4, 2023, Warren Buffett and his team oversaw a $342 billion investment portfolio containing 49 securities (47 stocks and two exchange-traded funds). A whopping 53% of Buffett's portfolio was tied up in just two stocks, even though Buffett had a boatload of capital to work with. (Note, this figure includes assets from the Oracle of Omaha's secret portfolio, New England Asset Management.) Apple: $151,644,266,071 (44.4% of invested assets) There's absolutely no question that Warren Buffett enjoys running a relatively concentrated portfolio, once you take a closer look at Berkshire Hathaway's stake in tech-stock Apple (AAPL 1.56%). Labeled as one of Berkshire's ""four giants"" by the Oracle of Omaha in his 2021 letter to shareholders, Apple is closing in on a 45% weighting within Berkshire's portfolio. Apple checks all the right boxes for the long-term-minded Warren Buffett. For starters, it's one of the most well-known companies in the world and has quite the loyal customer base. Interbrand has labeled Apple the world's most valuable brand for 10 years running, while Kantar BrandZ announced last year that, based on its survey, Apple had reclaimed the top spot in brand value. The company's products are also well-loved. Since late 2020, which is when Apple's first 5G iPhone hit sales floors, the company has accounted for around 50% of all U.S. smartphone market share. Likewise, Apple's share of U.S. personal computer (PC) shipments is on the rise. The 17.2% share of the PC market that the company's Mac computers claimed in the fourth quarter of 2022 was a decade high. However, Berkshire's $151.6 billion stake in Apple is also a reflection of Warren Buffett implicitly trusting Apple's CEO Tim Cook. While not abandoning the physical products that made Apple what it is today, Cook is leading an ongoing shift to a subscription-driven operating model. Focusing on services should help Apple generate predictable, high-margin revenue. Further, it'll help minimize the revenue ebbs and flows that are often observed during iPhone replacement cycles. But the biggest lure of all might just be Apple's capital-return program. In terms of nominal dollars, the nearly $14.6 billion Apple doles out in dividends each year to its shareholders is one of the largest payouts on the planet. The company has also repurchased well over $550 billion worth of its common stock over a 10-year period. These buybacks are growing Berkshire's stake in Apple without Buffett's company lifting a finger. There's no question Apple has been a phenomenal investment for Warren Buffett and his team. But with its growth engine stalled and its valuation inflated, relative to where it was even five years ago, I believe it's fair to suggest that Apple isn't very attractive at its current price. Image source: Getty Images. Bank of America: $28,899,199,128 (8.5% of invested assets) The other top holding that collectively accounts for 53% of invested assets in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio is Bank of America (BAC -0.24%). Inclusive of Buffett's secret portfolio, Berkshire holds more than 1.03 billion shares of BofA. Of all the sectors and industries the Oracle of Omaha can invest in, there's arguably none he understands better than banking. In particular, Buffett appreciates the cyclical nature of the industry. Cyclical stocks operate in lockstep with the U.S. or global economy. They thrive during economic expansions and struggle during contractions. But even though recessions are an inevitable part of the economic cycle, they're usually short-lived. Every recession after World War II has lasted just two to 18 months. Comparatively, expansions are often measured in years. Buffett and his investing lieutenants, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, are leaning on history and allowing their cyclical stocks to benefit from these long-winded expansions. There's no need to time the market when bull markets are disproportionately longer to begin with. However, Warren Buffett wouldn't be holding a $28.9 billion stake in Bank of America if there weren't company-specific catalysts, as well. Perhaps the biggest of these is the company's interest-rate sensitivity. As a general rule, bank stocks benefit when the Federal Reserve raises interest rates. Lending institutions with outstanding variable-rate loans should enjoy an increase in net interest income when rates climb. Under normal conditions, the nation's central bank would be cutting rates in response to a weaker economy or a bear market for equities. But with the U.S. inflation rate coming off four-decade highs in June 2022, the Fed has little choice but to tackle its most pressing issue. As rates continue to rise, no money-center bank is reaping the benefit more than Bank of America. Something else you might not realize about BofA is that it's done an admirable job of incorporating technology into the banking experience. As of the end of 2022, it had 44 million digital users, and its members were completing just shy of half of all loan sales online or via a mobile app. Additionally, 63 million more digital Zelle payments were sent during the fourth quarter than checks were written. Digital transactions are notably more cost-effective than in-person interactions for banks. Lastly, it's pretty evident Warren Buffett trusts BofA CEO Brian Moynihan. On top of fortifying Bank of America's balance sheet following the Great Recession, Moynihan and BofA's board haven't been shy about rewarding their faithful shareholders. Between dividends and share buybacks, it's not out of the ordinary for Bank of America to return in excess of $20 billion annually to its shareholders when the U.S. economy is expanding.

April 6, 2023 12:55 PM |  7 min read Advertiser DisclosureFinancial industry turmoil and debate over the Fed’s rate path set the stage for a Q1 earnings season that might raise more questions about corporate health than it answers.Major banks and airlines open the season in mid-April after a disappointing Q4 that saw S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) fall nearly 4%. The slump is widely expected to worsen in Q1, falling more than 6% year over year, according to research firm FactSet.The definition of an “earnings recession” is when earnings decline two quarters in a row. If analysts are right, we’re about to be in one.What’s the problem? A bunch of things, including the strong dollar, slowing consumer and business demand, tough comparisons versus year-ago earnings, and rising interest rates as the Federal Reserve again tightened the screws at its March meeting. All these factors can slow earnings growth, with some sectors pressured more than others.One thing you probably can’t blame for Q1’s troubles—though it’s likely to have an impact later this year—is the recent banking turmoil. More on that below.More pain seen aheadBefore touching on Q1 earnings expectations by sector, let’s review a few reasons why many analysts remain bearish on the earnings outlook for Q1 and beyond: Recent downward momentum in revisions by companies. Through late March, 79 S&P 500 companies had issued negative earnings per share guidance for Q1 versus just 27 that issued positive guidance, according to FactSet. The lagging impact of tighter monetary policy is still working through the economy and input costs remain high for many segments of the market, says Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab. Decelerating growth continues to weigh on productivity. The Leading Economic Index (LEI) from The Conference Board fell again in February and is down month over month for 11 consecutive months (a streak only seen during recessions). The ISM Manufacturing Index’s new orders component remains in contraction where it’s been for six consecutive months. Rapid disinflation on the goods side of the economy is sending a worrisome signal for revenue and profits, especially given S&P revenue growth in 2022 was mostly due to high inflation (unit growth was mediocre), Sonders notes. Beyond that, recent layoffs across the info tech sector, including Amazon’s (AMZN) late-March announcement that it would lay off workers in its cloud business, has driven negative sentiment heading into earnings. The mega-cap tech companies, including AMZN, Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) all disappointed with their earnings last time out, and more negative news from any or all of them might taint this earnings season, too.That said, it’s likely that big banks will set the tone as they kick off the earnings season the middle of next month as they’re center stage in the recent financial turmoil. Big Q1 declines seen for materials, real estate, health careEight of 11 S&P 500 sectors are expected to see earnings fall year over year in Q1, according to research firm CFRA, with the worst losses coming from materials, real estate, health care, and communication services. However, consumer discretionary, industrials, and energy all could see better than 13% year-over-year EPS gains in Q1, CFRA forecasts. The closely watched financials sector is expected see EPS fall nearly 8% in Q1 and fall more than 2% for calendar year 2023, CFRA says.Analysts expect a 6.6% earnings decline across all sectors in Q1, according to FactSet’s latest data released March 31. That reflects declining hopes since the start of the year, when the average Q1 estimate was for just a slight decrease, according to FactSet. The trend for nearly a year now has been falling analyst estimates over the course of the quarter as companies guide lower. Materials, consumer discretionary and industrials are the three sectors where earnings estimates have fallen most since the start of the year, FactSet noted. Familiar companies that have seen estimates fall substantially include Amazon, Tesla (TSLA), United Airlines (UAL), and Boeing (BA).While CFRA still sees overall 2023 S&P 500 earnings per share (EPS) falling just slightly from last year’s $219.25, some analysts are far more bearish, projecting EPS of $200 or less.Banking turmoil’s impactThe elephant in the room is credit, both for consumers and businesses, and it could tighten if banks and their balance sheets come under more scrutiny. Banks may become more reluctant to lend to certain businesses, which could dry up venture capital, commercial real estate, and other businesses dependent on a relatively free flow of funds.Ultimately, this would likely lead to slower economic growth and almost certainly to less direct business for banks. Keep an eye on credit spreads to get a sense of whether business activity is slowing, which would likely factor into falling earnings expectations as the year advances.There’ve also already been more calls for bank regulation in the wake of this instability. Tighter regulation, if it comes, often means narrowing opportunity for banks to grow their businesses.Earnings, even more than the Fed, play directly into stock valuations. Heading into earnings season, the SPX had a 12-month forward Price-Earnings (P/E) ratio near 18, close to the 10-year average, according to FactSet. That sounds relatively benign, and certainly could be if the “E” part of the equation remains stable. Analysts expect earnings to rebound smartly later in 2023, thanks in part to hopes for an improving economy and easier comparison to the previous year in coming quarters.With Q1 earnings not even started, it’s a bit early to start worrying about the full year. But if analysts start rolling back their earnings estimates for later this year, P/E could start looking higher than normal unless the SPX declines. That’s why company guidance in coming weeks for Q2 and beyond is so important and will likely invite as much or more scrutiny as Q1 performance numbers roll in. Analysts have their pencils and scorecards ready, so to speak, and could mark them with red ink if they don’t like what they hear from some of the major companies. If the red ink flows toward full-year earnings expectations, it’ll be tough sledding for market bulls hoping for a 2023 Fed “pause” rally or a possible rate cut by later this year. The Fed can perhaps take its foot off the brake a bit, though inflation remains near 5%, making that a tough call.  But if companies can’t find a way to improve margins and boost profits, any stock market rally based on rates could be called into question. In late March, for instance, Nike (NKE) shares slipped despite strong earnings, hurt by worries over the company’s slumping gross margin amid inventory issues. Margins come into sharp focus during earnings season, and more companies could see their stocks punished if they can’t promise better profits ahead. Unfortunately, inflation remains a problem, giving companies the unappetizing choice of raising prices or eating the higher wholesale costs (and hurting their margins). In late March, for instance, Nike (NKE) shares slipped despite strong earnings, hurt by worries over the company’s slumping gross margin amid inventory issues.

Unfortunately, inflation remains a problem, giving companies the unappetizing choice of raising prices or eating the higher wholesale costs (and hurting their margins).Bright Spot?Though earnings season is still over a week away, a smattering of company reports in the final week of March inspired some optimism in a market that’s grown used to expecting poor quarterly results. When you look over the companies that reported recently, including Walgreen’s Boots Alliance (WBA), lululemon (LULU), Micron (MU), Carnival (CCL), McCormick (MCK), and Paychex (PAYX), there was a lot to like even if not all of them sounded incredibly optimistic about the rest of the year.By and large, these firms either beat Wall Street’s expectations or gave investors reasons to hope the worst of their earnings struggles may be behind.Another positive feature in the recent flurry of company reports was the top line, which is a lot harder for corporate finance whizzes to dress up. The bottom line is typically where you can find ways to “window dress” a quarter and make it look a bit healthier than it may have actually been. Revenue, on the other hand, is going to either be good or bad, and kind of speaks for itself. Approximately 75% of S&P companies that reported in March’s final week beat analysts’ revenue expectations. That’s an area to watch as earnings season begins.TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

Benzinga Editor April 6, 2023 12:01 PM |  2 min read Needham analyst Laura Martin reiterates a Hold rating on Walt Disney Co DIS. The re-rating reflects rising DTC losses and Martin's belief that consensus estimates for Disney are too high owing to high investment levels in DTC and another year of weak earnings from linear TV and the box office. Longer-term, Martin believes Disney's asset mix of both digital and physical assets (i.e., an Omniverse) maximizes its economic value capture.Martin sees Disney as the streaming winner in the longer term, backed by superior marketing skills, lower SAC, strong IP franchises, A+ library titles, and world-class storytellers at Pixar, Lucas Films, and Marvel and ownership of its content studios.Disney best in class library positions it for success in metaverse or AI like ChatGPT.CEO Bob Iger ""won"" the battle in Florida against Florida governor Ron DeSantis by promising to invest $17 billion in Florida to create 13,000 new Disney jobs, accusing DeSantis of being anti-business, and defending Disney's point of view by using ""freedom of speech and ideas"" metaphors. However, Iger's 2-year contract has 18 more months.Martin believes OTT consolidation will begin in 2023, and Disney will command the highest takeover premium. Martin sees Apple Inc AAPL, Microsoft Corp MSFT, and Amazon.Com Inc AMZN are logical bidders for DIS's 100-year-old brands and library IP. Disney has promised $5.5 billion of cost savings, including non-content cost savings of $2.5 billion ($1 billion in FY23) and content cost savings of $3 billion. Disney has already announced a 7,000-person headcount reduction. Also, Disney promised peak losses in streaming last year, which should drive faster EPS growth upside in FY23.Martin highlights Disney's dividend reinstatement potential. Martin believes Disney's natural shareholder base is retail investors wanting to put Disney shares into their retirement accounts. However, this same group of investors often requires dividends to live on. By implication, if Disney reinstates its dividend, a large pool of buyers for Disney shares will return to the stock.DIS's promised reorganization by YE23 into three core segments (Disney Entertainment, ESPN, Disney Parks, Experiences, and Products) highlights Disney's creative engine at the core of its value proposition. Martin believes the reorganization will aid morale while cutting costs. Also, Martin would like to see Disney auction off a 10% passive interest in ESPN and use that cash to repay debt and use ESPN-specific equity to lower the cash cost per year for the upcoming NBA renewal rights for ESPN.Price Action: DIS shares traded lower by 0.36% at $98.98 on the last check Thursday.EarningsAnalyst RatingsOptionsDividendsIPOsClick to see more Analyst Ratings updates© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement CIEN +1.61% LITE +0.62% AAPL -0.14% Ciena Corp. reaffirmed its outlook Thursday after optical-networking component maker Lumentum Holdings Inc. lowered its own forecast the previous afternoon, citing an order cancellation from a major customer.  See also: Lumentum stock sinks nearly 10% after forecast revision Networking company Ciena CIEN, +1.61% continues to expect $1.035 billion to $1.115 billion in fiscal second-quarter revenue, along with adjusted gross margins in the low 40% range and adjusted operating expenses of about $335 million.  Additionally, Ciena is sticking with its full-year outlook for 2023, which calls for 20% to 22% revenue growth, adjusted gross margins of 42% to 44% and adjusted operating expenses of about $330 million a quarter for the balance of the period.  Ciena “is reaffirming its previous statements with respect to both the demand environment and the normalization of backlog and inventory dynamics,” the company said in a release.  Shares of Ciena, off as much as 8.2% earlier in Thursday morning’s action, were paring losses and down 4.7% after the company gave its update.  Lumentum LITE, +0.62% disclosed late Wednesday that it no longer expected to meet its prior revenue forecast, as a corporate customer that made up more than 10% of its quarterly revenue in the fiscal second quarter had canceled an order late in Lumentum’s fiscal third quarter. In Lumentum’s last annual filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the company disclosed only Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.14% and Ciena as representing more than 10% of its sales. Analysts generally seemed to think Ciena was the customer Lumentum was referring to, though Jefferies analyst George Notter didn’t think the update should necessarily spark concern.  “We don’t believe the [Lumentum] pre-announcement tells us much about fundamental end-market demand for Ciena, positively or negatively,” Notter wrote overnight, prior to Ciena’s own update.  Notter offered that there could be “a number of reasons” Ciena might have canceled an order, including that lead times for Lumentum components were coming down or that Ciena “simply over-bought from Lumentum relative to their business outlook,” among other possibilities.

Thankfully, depositors didn't lose any money, but the crisis left at least one important lesson behind. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Understanding a company's cash position should be part of every investor's due diligence process. The banking industry, government regulators, and investors alike are still processing the March 10 collapse of SVB Financial, the parent company of Silicon Valley Bank (SVB). It was the second-largest bank failure in U.S. history, with $175 billion in customer deposits on the line. But this crisis had one unique (and worrying) feature: Just 6% of those deposits fell within the $250,000 deposit insurance limit mandated by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC). Most of SVB's customers were technology companies, investors, and high-net-worth individuals, which meant the majority of them faced the prospect of a total loss. Regulation saved the day Thanks to prudent regulations that prevent banks like SVB from using customer funds to make risky investments, there actually wasn't an asset shortfall at all -- in other words, the bank was in a position to cover all deposits, it just had to liquidate its investment portfolios (it had an estimated $209 billion in assets at the time of failure). Those portfolios consisted mostly of bonds and government Treasury bills, which are typically incredibly safe assets. But the rapid increase in interest rates over the last 18 months pushed the value of those bond portfolios lower (when a bond yields a higher interest rate, its value falls, and vice versa). At the same time, SVB's tech-sector customers were raising less money and burning through more cash, which was shrinking its deposit base. Additionally, customers were moving money to higher-yielding accounts, money market funds, and Treasury bills themselves to earn more interest on their deposits. A combination of those factors forced SVB to liquidate $21 billion worth of bonds and Treasuries at a $1.8 billion loss so it could meet depositors' requests. The bank then attempted to raise money from investors to plug that hole, and when word began to circulate the institution might be in trouble, depositors began to flee en masse. SVB expected to lose a whopping $100 billion in deposits on the Friday that it failed which it didn't have the liquidity to cover, but thanks to a lightning-fast intervention by the FDIC, the bank was shut down before that could happen. It allowed the federal government to step in and announce deposits of all sizes would be safe, and it also gave the Federal Reserve time to set up an ""at-par"" lending facility to banks, which meant they could temporarily plug any financial holes caused by the declining values of their bond portfolios. This measure shored up customers' confidence in the rest of the banking system. But this crisis came with important lessons attached, even if you don't invest in banks or financial sector stocks. Here's one thing technology investors can take away from the SVB collapse. Invest in companies with ultrastrong balance sheets A company has a strong balance sheet if it has enough cash and short-term liquidity to comfortably service its liabilities, like loans and other costs. Fortunately, the technology sector is filled with great examples -- two of the best are fierce rivals Apple (AAPL 1.56%) and Microsoft (MSFT 1.10%). Both have built their fortress balance sheets on the backs of their incredible cash-generating businesses. In fact, Apple brings in so much money it returned $104 billion to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases in fiscal 2022 (ended Sept. 24) alone. The company still has over $51 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term marketable securities on its balance sheet, and since it spent only $9.5 billion servicing its debts in fiscal 2022, it still has plenty of runway. Not to mention, Apple brought in $30 billion in net income (profit) in the recent first quarter of fiscal 2023 (ended Dec 31), so it's likely to continue piling up cash this year. Consumers love the company's portfolio of devices like the iPhone, iPad, and Mac computers, and its services including Apple Music, Apple Pay, and iCloud, so it's likely to remain a financial powerhouse for years to come. Microsoft is in a similar position, though it has a different strategy from Apple in that it invests heavily in entering new industries to expand its footprint in the tech sector. Having started out in software with its Windows operating system, the company now operates one of the largest cloud services platforms in the world, it's a leader in the gaming industry, and it's becoming a front-runner in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. In fact, it recently committed to a multiyear investment deal with ChatGPT creator OpenAI, which is rumored to be worth $10 billion. But Microsoft does have two things in common with Apple: Its cash position and its profitability. The company is sitting on $99.5 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments, and in the recent fiscal 2023 second quarter (ended Dec. 31), it generated $16.4 billion in net income. But a strong balance sheet alone won't always make for a great investment During what can only be described as a frenzy in the stock market during 2020 and 2021, many technology companies took advantage of their sky-high valuations to raise piles of cash from investors. As a result, they're sitting in a great financial position today even if their businesses aren't exactly performing well. Investment platform to Generation Z Robinhood Markets (HOOD 1.07%) is one example. It has over $6.3 billion in cash with no debt, yet investors have sent its stock price plunging 88% from its all-time high, valuing the company at just $8.4 billion as of this writing. That means they attribute only $2.1 billion of value to the business itself -- in other words, the cash on Robinhood's balance sheet is worth three times as much as the business it operates. When the pandemic era of government stimulus and ultralow interest rates ended in late 2021, Robinhood's young user base became less active in the financial markets. At the end of 2022, its monthly active user base had declined 46% from its peak in the year prior, coming in at 11.4 million. Similarly, the value of the cash and assets customers are holding with Robinhood is down 39% from its peak, to $62 billion. As a result, the company's quarterly revenue remained well below peak 2021 levels throughout last year. Investors typically don't want to own shares in a shrinking business. Therefore, Robinhood's incredibly strong balance sheet won't be enough to buoy its stock price in the long run, making it a difficult company to invest in.

Alphabet's Google unit plans to add artificial intelligence features to its search engine, the Wall Street Journal reported.Adding to recent data hinting at a weak labor market, initial jobless claims fell to a seasonally adjusted 228,000 for the week ended April 1, versus expectations of 200,000 claims.The Labor Department's data from the prior week was revised to show 48,000 more applications were received.The S&P 500 climbed 0.36% to end the session at 4,105.02 points.The Nasdaq gained 0.76% to 12,087.96 points, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.01% to 33,485.29 points.Wall Street has lost ground in recent days in response to signs of a slowing economy, including weak data on private payrolls and job openings earlier this week.That marked a change from recent months, when investors cheered weak economic data on the basis that it might mean the Fed's interest rate hikes were working and that the Fed could ease up on its campaign to rein in decades-high inflation.Interest rate futures imply traders are divided about whether the Fed will raise its target rate or keep it steady at its upcoming May meeting, according to CME Group's Fedwatch tool.""The market is trying to decide whether the 'growth and recession' scare or the 'Fed hiking' scare are more meaningful to prices, and so it's waffling between whether a softening labor market is good news because it gets the Fed to pause in May or bad news because it means the recession is actually coming,"" said Ross Mayfield, an investment strategy analyst at Baird in Louisville, Kentucky.Investors are now focused on the more comprehensive report on non-farm payrolls, which are expected to have increased by 239,000 in March, down from the 311,000 jobs added in the prior month. That report is due on Friday, when the U.S. stock market will be closed for the Good Friday holiday.Traders work on the trading floor at the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, U.S., March 31, 2023.

Here's Where I Start. By Stefon Walters – Apr 6, 2023 at 5:17AM Key Points Value investors look for stocks trading below their intrinsic value. A company's P/E ratio tells you how much you're paying for each dollar of its earnings. To effectively use P/E ratios, you need to compare them with similar companies in the same industry. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: GOOGL Alphabet Market Cap $1,570B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.16%) $1.43 Current Price $125.07 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More With enough time and research, finding undervalued stocks can pay off big-time for investors. There are many different styles people take when approaching investing. One of those styles is value investing, which is looking for stocks trading below the price they're really worth. This can be as complicated as determining a stock's intrinsic value. For example, if a company is trading at $100 per share and an investor believes its intrinsic value is $125, they'd invest, hoping the stock market eventually prices it at $125 and they'll have 25% gains. But there are simple ways to use value investing principles, too. If you're looking to find undervalued stocks, look no further than a company's price-to-earnings ratio. Image source: Getty Images. Don't forget about the earnings The price-to-earnings ratio, or P/E ratio, is helpful because it tells you how much you're paying for each dollar of a company's earnings. You can find a company's P/E ratio by dividing its current stock price by its earnings per share (EPS). For example, if a stock is trading at $100 and has an EPS of $5, its P/E ratio would be 20, meaning you're paying $20 for each $1 of earnings. The P/E ratio alone won't tell you a stock's value, because different industries naturally have different P/E ratios. A large reason is that investors of companies in higher-growth industries are more willing to pay a higher price now for future growth. The banking industry, for example, typically operates with low P/E ratios, while healthcare is typically much higher. That's why you wouldn't compare JPMorgan Chase's P/E ratio to Johnson and Johnson's, or Apple's to Walt Disney's. You could, however, compare JPMorgan to Goldman Sachs, or Apple to Microsoft. If you're examining a company and its P/E ratio is noticeably lower than other companies in its industry, it could be undervalued -- for instance, if a company has a P/E ratio in the 10s but competitors are in the 20s or 30s. It's important to understand the reasons why that might be -- as we'll touch on in the next section -- but if you're looking for undervalued stocks, it's a reason to investigate. Understanding the why behind a company's P/E ratio Let's use Alphabet (GOOGL 1.16%) as an example. At recent prices, the company has a P/E ratio hovering around 23, less than half as much as just five years ago. That tells you the stock is cheaper than it's been in recent years. That doesn't necessarily make it undervalued. However, when you zoom out and compare it to other Big Tech peers, the argument can be made it's undervalued by comparison. DATA BY YCharts Since P/E ratios decrease when stock prices decrease, it's equally important to understand the why behind a stock's current levels. You want to ensure it's truly undervalued and not a justly priced bad investment. A glance at Alphabet's EPS history shows profit growth has slipped lately. But it's not the only one in that position, and its growth in recent years has still been strong. DATA BY YCharts Alphabet's slowing digital ad spending could be a reason why the market has soured. But an argument could be made that with macroeconomic conditions, it doesn't warrant the company losing more than 25% of its market value over the past year -- especially given its track record. What next? The P/E ratio isn't the final word on whether a stock is undervalued or not. But understanding what it's telling you about market sentiment is a good place to start your research. In the case of Alphabet, you might also ask: What could drive Alphabet's EPS growth higher in the future? Since the S&P 500's P/E is around 18 lately, will Alphabet grow so much faster that it deserves a higher multiple? Everyone likes a good value or discount, especially in the stock market. That's most of the appeal behind value investing. It does take time and research, but using a metric like the P/E ratio comparatively gives much more insight -- not only into a specific company, but also its competitors and the industry it operates in.

One FAANG component has a trio of operating segments poised to deliver significant growth in profits and cash flow. Meanwhile, sales and profits for another top-tier FAANG stock are stuck in reverse.

Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Among Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook), Apple, Amazon, Netflix, and Alphabet (formerly Google), there's one bargain-priced industry leader begging to be bought, as well as one outperformer that's now far too pricey. Things don't always go as planned when investing in the stock market. Even though the major U.S. indexes tend to rise in value over long periods, stock market corrections, crashes, and bear markets are a normal part of the long-term investing cycle. Over the past 15 months, volatility and uncertainty have picked up in a big way, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite all falling into respective bear markets. But when the going gets tough on Wall Street, investors have a tendency to turn to long-term outperformers, such as the FAANG stocks. Image source: Getty Images. The FAANG stocks have run circles around Wall Street By FAANG, I'm referring to: Facebook, which is a subsidiary of Meta Platforms (META 1.09%) Apple (AAPL 1.56%) Amazon (AMZN 1.10%) Netflix (NFLX 1.49%) Google, which is a subsidiary of Alphabet (GOOGL 1.16%) (GOOG 0.92%) Over the trailing decade (as of March 31, 2023), the benchmark S&P 500 has returned a respectable 162%. By comparison, Netflix, Apple, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet (specifically the Class A shares, GOOGL) have respectively returned 1,180%, 942%, 729%, 675%, and 422% over the same time span. These stocks are running circles around Wall Street, which is why investors often flock to them when volatility picks up or a broader-market correction takes place. Another reason these stocks are beloved by investors is because they're industry leaders in one capacity or another. For example: Meta Platforms owns four of the most-popular social media sites in the world (Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger). Apple's iPhone accounts for around half of all U.S. smartphone market share since 5G-capable versions went on sale in late 2020. Amazon's online marketplace was responsible for an estimated 39.5% of U.S. online retail sales in 2022, according to a report by eMarketer. Netflix is the global and domestic leader in streaming content market share. Alphabet's internet search engine Google accounted for more than 93% of worldwide search share in February 2023. But in spite of their long-term outperformance, not all FAANG stocks are created equal. In April, one FAANG stock stands out for being historically cheap, while another looks particularly pricey and should be avoided like the plague. The FAANG stock investors can buy hand over fist in April: Amazon Among the five FAANG stocks, the one that stands out as the best value in April is e-commerce kingpin Amazon. Like every single stock on the planet, Amazon has headwinds and risks it's contending with, the most prominent being the growing risk the U.S. economy will fall into a recession at some point in the not-too-distant future. Since a majority of Amazon's revenue is generated from retail sales, the inference is that the company could struggle if consumers pare back their discretionary spending. However, there's a pretty sizable flaw with using retail weakness as an excuse to avoid Amazon. Despite the online marketplace being Amazon's primary revenue driver, it doesn't play a particularly important role in cash-flow generation or operating income. Even if Amazon's e-commerce division sees sales reverse, the company's operating cash flow can sustain double-digit growth as long as a trio of ancillary operating segments continue to fire on all cylinders. Although Amazon's online marketplace isn't paramount to profits, the Prime memberships the marketplace helps lure certainly are. Two years ago, Amazon announced that it had surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers. As of the end of 2020, the company was generating $28 billion in annual run-rate sales from subscriptions. Since then, the price of a Prime membership has increased, and Amazon gained the rights to Thursday Night Football. Subscription services is now a $37 billion segment on an annual run-rate basis. In other words, the company's global Prime member count is likely well above 200 million. Advertising services is the second key segment for Amazon. While it's not in the same class as Alphabet or Meta when it comes to driving advertising revenue, Amazon is netting well over 2 billion visits on a monthly basis. That's more than enough of a dangling carrot to put ad-pricing power in Amazon's court. Despite the challenging growth environment in 2022, Amazon's ad services segment delivered quarterly year-over-year sales growth ranging between 21% and 30%, sans currency movements. The third ancillary division -- and the one that's arguably most important to Amazon's cash flow -- is Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS has gobbled up 32% of global cloud infrastructure service market share, which is excellent news considering enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings of growth. Best of all, AWS's exceptionally high margins provide anywhere from 50% to 100% of Amazon's annual operating income, even though AWS only accounts for about a sixth of the company's net sales. Based solely on the traditional price-to-earnings ratio, Amazon isn't much of a looker. But it doesn't make a lot of sense to use a traditional valuation metric to assess a company that reinvests the vast majority of its operating cash flow. Throughout the 2010s, investors willingly paid between 23 and 37 times year-end cash flow to own shares of Amazon. Investors buying shares of Amazon in April are paying approximately 13 times Wall Street's consensus cash flow for 2023 and just 7 forecast cash flow for 2026. On the basis of cash flow, Amazon stock is cheaper than it's ever been. Image source: Getty Images. The FAANG stock to avoid like the plague in April: Apple However, there are two sides to every coin. While tech stock Apple is a phenomenal business, it's this month's FAANG stock to avoid for a variety of reasons. Let's state the obvious: Apple isn't a train wreck. There's a reason it's Warren Buffett's top holding at Berkshire Hathaway and the largest publicly traded company by market cap in the United States. In calendar year 2022, Apple generated more than $109 billion in operating cash flow. Apple's capital-return program is also the envy of pretty much every publicly traded company. It's repurchased in excess of $550 billion worth of its common stock since the beginning of 2013 -- that's more than the market caps of all but seven S&P 500 companies, which includes Apple -- and is parsing out nearly $14.6 billion in dividends annually. In other words, if you're holding on to Apple for five or more years to come, there's a pretty good chance your initial investment will grow in value. But if you're looking for a market-topping return or a deal, don't expect to find it here. The allure of Apple has long been its supercharged growth prospects for a mega-cap company. Unfortunately, that's not what investors are getting right now. Mediocre sales following the launch of iPhone 14 coerced Apple to pull back on plans to expand production in September. Even though the company is strongly promoting fast-growing subscription services, physical products like the iPhone generate a majority of its sales. What makes the iPhone 14's so-so sales performance even more painful is that Apple has historically seen high inflation as a tailwind. Despite inflation pacing between 6% and 9% for much of the past year, Apple's full-year revenue for fiscal 2023 is expected to decline by 1%, according to Wall Street. To add fuel to the fire, Apple has relied on its mammoth share repurchase program to provide a boost to its earnings per share. Even with ongoing share buybacks, Apple's earnings per share is expected to decline by 2% in fiscal 2023. In short, none of the tools that have fueled Apple's outperformance in the past are on pace to help its top or bottom line grow in 2023. During bear markets, it's normal for investors to be more critical of company valuations. Following last week's strong performance for the broader market, Apple is commanding a multiple of 25 times forward-year earnings despite its lack of growth in the current fiscal year. Compare this figure to the multiple of 10 to 15 times forward-year earnings Apple consistently traded at from 2013 through 2018, and you'll see just how pricey Apple is in the current environment.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Wall Street Says 3 of Q1's Hottest Tech Stocks Are Done Rallying... at Least for Now By James Brumley – Apr 6, 2023 at 5:05AM Key Points The metaverse isn't quite living up to the hype voiced just a couple of years ago, raising questions about Roblox's growth potential. Now that EV newness has worn off and competition is creeping in, investors are rethinking Tesla's pricing paradigm. Spotify's adaptation and growth initiatives could prove slower, more complicated, and costlier than the market currently expects. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: RBLX Roblox Market Cap $24B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.67%) $0.26 Current Price $38.95 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More There are reasons most analysts are sticking with their previously established valuation calls. As the old adage goes, ""Past performance does not guarantee future results."" More to the point, there's no assurance that three of the first quarter's hottest technology stocks will be able to repeat the feat in the second quarter. Each ticker is near, at, or even beyond Wall Street's consensus target price (and it's not like analysts haven't had ample opportunity to raise their targets since these rallies began). Here's a closer look at these three names and their current situations. If you own any or all of them, it might be smart to reassess your reasons for holding these stocks. If they're a true long-term holding, so be it. If they're more of a trade, though, the trade's likely run its course. 1. Roblox Q1 gain: 58%Current price: $46.58Consensus price target: $39.40 The big gain dished out by metaverse outfit Roblox (RBLX 0.67%) shares since the end of 2022 makes enough sense on the surface. Last year was disastrous for the stock. The company went public at the height of 2021's metaverse mania, but as the COVID-19 pandemic eased and enthusiasm about the metaverse waned, so did investors' interest. The bear market certainly didn't help either. It's easy to look back and think the sellers overshot their target, though. The Q1 rally simply corrects that mistake. But there are still more questions than answers for Roblox. Chief among the questions are February's activity measures and their implications. By and large, they were solid. The number of daily active users grew 22% year over year, while the total number of hours spent playing within its virtual worlds improved 24%. The single-digit decline in the number of average sessions for daily users, however, could be a subtle early sign that its reach is peaking. Underscoring this idea is the fact that the same measure was essentially flat for January rather than up. Perhaps worse, this month's posting of these vital user metrics for March will be the company's last such report, obscuring a full view of the company's health at a time when Roblox should be demonstrating the importance of its role in the metaverse movement. Indeed, the decision could be interpreted as a deliberate move to obscure slowing growth stemming from weakening interest. NPD Group reports that sales of the virtual reality headsets needed to enter the metaverse actually fell 12% last year. Growing losses in spite of persistent revenue growth, and frequent misses of earnings estimates, are also becoming habits that ultimately work against the stock. 2. Tesla Q1 gain: 68%Current price: $191.64Consensus price target: $205.54 For the record, shares of electric vehicle (EV) maker Tesla (TSLA 1.45%) aren't quite to their consensus target of $205.54 just yet. They're close, sitting a mere 7% below that mark after failing to make any forward progress since mid-February's high. That may not be enough upside potential to justify the downside risk of this stock at this time. For years Elon Musk's Tesla was a company that could do no wrong, represented by a stock that rarely stayed down for long. As Tesla reached a massive scale and viable competition crept into the EV space, however, the stock's reliable bullishness and the bullish narrative surrounding the company suffered. Case in point: Despite a 44% year-over-year increase to 440,808 manufactured vehicles during Q1 and delivering a record-breaking 422,875 EVs in the same quarter, shares fell following the news. Why? Analysts were expecting deliveries of more than 430,000 battery-powered cars stemming from demand that was supposed to be spurred by price cuts. The modest inventory buildup further points to a possible slowdown in demand for Tesla's EVs. These worries are arguably overblown. After all, the Tesla name is nearly synonymous with electric vehicles, accounting for the majority of EV sales after Musk mainstreamed the EV movement. That's apt to remain the case for the indefinite future, too. True long-term investors can confidently step into or stick with the stock here. If you're only willing or able to hold Tesla shares as a near-term trade, there's above-average danger in doing so right now. This stock's increasingly being treated as a mature growth name rather than the must-have Wall Street darling it was during its earliest years of existence. This new dynamic is vexing investors, leaving shares vulnerable to volatility while the market gets a grip on this stock's new norm. 3. Spotify Technology Q1 gain: 69%Current price: $134.66Consensus price target: $136.44 Shares of Sweden's Spotify Technology (SPOT 0.82%) are rallying for understandable reasons. The digital radio platform passed 500 million listeners last month, and by leveraging AI-powered music suggestions along with short-form video and podcasts, the company believes it can grow its customer headcount to 1 billion by 2030. With the stock up nearly 70% just over the course of the past three months, though, the bulls have arguably gotten more than a little ahead of themselves. Don't misunderstand. A billion paying customers isn't an outrageous outlook in light of everything the app does and will eventually offer. Some analysts also argue the service is underpriced in certain markets (including in the U.S.), leaving room for a price increase that won't prompt a wave of cancellations. Guggenheim's Michael Morris is one of these analysts, upgrading SPOT stock to a buy last month to reflect ""our estimate of subscription plan price increases, which we expect will take effect on a broad geographic basis in mid-2023."" He adds that ""the music business gained scale and we see Spotify leadership continuing to recognize incremental efficiency as a value-creating strength that the company can disproportionally benefit from."" Translation? Look for losses to turn into profits as time marches on. The widening profit margins Morris believes are in the cards are a slow-moving train, reliant on business development initiatives that are still relatively foreign to Spotify in a market that includes stiff competition like Apple and Amazon. There's plenty of opportunity for stumbles and setbacks in the foreseeable future that could prompt a pullback. Conversely, there's not a lot of additional value left to pack into the stock's present price.

These prognostications won't matter over the years and decades to come. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.29%) -$0.53 Current Price $183.26 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More iPhone sales may be slowing, but the news wasn't all bad. What happened Shares of Apple (AAPL -0.29%) traded lower on Wednesday, slipping as much as 2.3%. When the market closed for the day, the stock was still down 1.1% A broad cross section of stocks ended the day lower, which no doubt helped fuel Apple's decline. More pertinent to Apple investors, one analyst raised the specter of slowing iPhone sales in the face of tough macroeconomic conditions, while another was moderately more bullish. So what Jefferies analyst Kyle McNealy dug deep on global web-traffic patterns and concluded that iPhone sales ""saw some deceleration"" during the month of February. As a result, the firm now believes sales likely ended the quarter in-line with expectations when they were previously ahead. More recent data suggests that average selling prices (ASPs) are higher than consensus estimates, according to the analyst, so Apple's revenue could still come in ahead of Wall Street's projections. The firm maintained its buy rating and $195 price target on the stock, which suggests potential gains for shareholders of 19% compared to Wednesday's closing price. At the same time, Bank of America (BofA) raised its price target on Apple to $168 from $158 and maintained a neutral rating on the shares. This suggests the analyst was playing catch up since Apple shares ended Tuesday at $165.63 -- above his previous call. After reading the tea leaves and checking sales channels, the firm believes the iPhones and services segments are ""stable to better,"" though Mac and iPad sales have suffered. He believes the combination will likely keep gross margins stable, and this stability ""modestly"" increases his expectations for the full year. Now what There's no question that Apple's success or failure rests mostly on iPhone sales, which represented 56% of the company's revenue in its fiscal first quarter ending Dec. 31. High inflation and economic uncertainty will almost certainly weigh on Apple's performance -- at least in the near term. Seasoned investors are keenly aware that ""this too shall pass."" By creating some of the most popular technology devices on the planet, it will certainly take more than a downturn to reverse Apple's long-term fortunes.

Tech-related stocks have rebounded after a brutal 2023 that saw them bear the brunt of a broad market selloff. “So far, the rally has largely reflected an unwinding of underweight positioning,” wrote strategists led by Binky Chadha, Deutsche Bank’s chief U.S. equity and global strategist. “We see the next leg being driven by earnings beats and rising forward estimates on which there has been very little focus so far.” Chadha and his team said a pickup in global growth in the near-term and a peak in the U.S. dollar point to a sizable rebound in earnings growth for megacap growth and tech stocks.  “The top-down drivers of overall earnings as well as those for megacap growth and tech stocks have been upgraded significantly in recent weeks, with our economists raising their near-term forecasts for GDP growth in the U.S., Europe, China and Japan for a variety of different reasons, while the dollar has fallen significantly.” The ICE U.S. Dollar Index DXY, -0.52%, a measure of the currency against a basket of six major rivals, has dropped 1.5% year-to-date as of Wednesday.  Deutsche Bank’s forecasts see tech earnings rebounding off the bottom of the trend channel, returning to trend levels in Q1 and then growing in line through the rest of 2023 and 2024. (See chart below) SOURCE: BLOOMBERG FINANCE LP, DEUTSCHE BANK ASSET ALLOCATION Tech stocks outperformed massively in the first half of 2020 in the pandemic boom when the Federal Reserve slashed interest rates and pumped trillions of dollars into economies. Stocks then went sideways for the next 18 months, before underperforming in 2022 when the central bank started its aggressive interest-rate hikes to curb the inflation.  See: What tech bust? Big Tech stocks gained $2 trillion in roaring start to 2023 Consensus estimates for tech earnings in the first quarter of 2023 have risen 1% since early February, the first upgrade in a year, and in contrast with continued downgrades to all the other major indexes, said Chadha. Meanwhile, the upgrades also came notably after the bulk of the last earnings season was over. That’s unusual, as estimates are typically flat to down between earnings seasons, he wrote. “In the last three earnings seasons, analysts saw next-quarter estimates fall between 1.5% and 3% at this stage. Even after the upgrades, our estimates suggest a 3.5% beat for megacap growth and tech stocks in Q1. This would be the biggest since Q4 2021 and follow four quarters of weak beats or outright misses which occurred despite estimates being cut going into reporting,” they wrote. If the Deutsche Bank forecasts are correct, that could imply that forward estimates of next 12 months earnings, which had fallen through 2022, should inflect up and keep rolling higher for the rest of 2023, said Chadha. U.S. stocks finished mostly lower on Wednesday as investors weighed data on private-sector employment and the services sector. The Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.66% slumped 1.1%, while the S&P 500 lost 0.3% and the Dow industrials gained 0.2%.

A bipartisan group of House lawmakers from the chamber’s Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party was expected to meet on Wednesday in Los Angeles with Walt Disney Co. DIS, +1.03% CEO Bob Iger and other entertainment-industry leaders. On Thursday, the committee members are slated to meet in the Bay Area with Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.69% President Brad Smith, executives from Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.72% GOOGL, +0.69% and Palantir Technologies Inc. PLTR, +1.44%, and other tech-industry figures, and they are due to talk on Friday with Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.20% CEO Tim Cook, according to multiple published reports. The chair of the select committee, Republican Rep. Mike Gallagher of Wisconsin, has been taking a tough stance toward U.S. enterprises that do business in China.  Gallagher said in a radio interview in January that “Big Tech has to confront the growing suspicion about their allegiances” and referred to “greedy executives in Hollywood.” He also promised to have Iger and NBA Commissioner Adam Silver testify before his panel. This month, the congressman has been among the U.S. lawmakers highlighting security concerns over the technology in cargo cranes made by Shanghai Zhenhua Heavy Industries Co. 600320, -0.55%, also known as ZPMC. Apple generates about 18% of its revenue from mainland China, according to FactSet data. For both Disney and Alphabet, China accounts for 4% of revenue; for Microsoft, it’s 12%; and for Palantir, it’s 7%. Both Democrats and Republicans appear increasingly eager to take a firm stand against Beijing. Signs of that came last month when TikTok’s CEO was grilled at a Capitol Hill hearing, as well as in January when the narrowly divided House voted overwhelmingly in favor of setting up the Select Committee on the CCP . “Congress, in our view, has determined that the status quo of U.S.-China relations is unacceptable, but lawmakers have yet to arrive at a shared legislative roadmap,” said Benjamin Salisbury, director of research at Height Capital Markets, in a note this week. Taiwanese President Tsai Ing-wen and U.S. Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy met at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, Calif., Wednesday. Tsai is on what is officially a stopover between Latin America and Taiwan. AFP via Getty Images “In that void, the Select Committee is likely to shape much of Congress’s rhetorical and legislative agenda,” he said. McCarthy, a California Republican, and Tsai made brief remarks on Wednesday at the Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., after their closed-door meeting, which was attended by members of the Select Committee on the CCP and other House lawmakers. “The friendship between the people of Taiwan and America is a matter of profound importance to the free world, and it is critical to maintain economic freedom, peace and regional stability,” McCarthy said. Taiwan is a self-governing island that is claimed by China. “It is no secret that today the peace that we have maintained and the democracy which we have worked hard to build are facing unprecedented challenges,” Tsai said. “We once again find ourselves in a world where democracy is under threat, and the urgency of keeping the beacon of freedom shining cannot be understated. President Reagan said it best: Freedom is never more than one generation away from extinction. It must be fought for and defended constantly by each generation,” she added.

Argus Research analyst Joseph Bonner upgraded Meta’s stock META, +0.62% to buy from hold Tuesday, writing that “the cost cuts do demonstrate prudence by management and should improve profitability,” even though Meta continues to face challenges related to the advertising market and Apple Inc.’s AAPL, -0.21% privacy-related changes. Meta is in the process of making “some of the deepest cost cuts in the tech sector,” in Bonner’s view, as the company has announced two sizable rounds of layoffs. Beyond Twitter, which slashed more than half its staff as Elon Musk took over the company, Meta’s headcount reduction is “significantly greater than at most peers.” Besides the cost cuts, Meta has other factors working in its favor as well, Bonner wrote, especially as some of its competitors experience problems. TikTok faces pushback from the U.S. government, while Twitter “has made a series of erratic strategic moves” under Musk’s leadership “that have hobbled the company.” “We believe that challenges at TikTok and Twitter could benefit Meta, which continues to add users to its platform,” Bonner wrote, noting that “an outright ban of TikTok is by no means certain, any regulatory trouble for this disruptive upstart would be a positive for Meta.” Meta “is almost entirely dependent on advertising revenue,” Bonner noted, and like other social-media players, it’s tried to diversify a bit. One new initiative is a subscription program that lets creators and others verify their identities.  “It remains unclear whether the new service will provide significant new revenue, though any incremental revenue should be ‘found money’ for Meta,” he wrote. Bonner joins several other analysts who’ve turned bullish on Meta’s shares in the wake of recent cost-cutting moves. See more: Meta’s stock has more than doubled since November.

Reports of more OLED-based products from Apple and Samsung are good news for the company. The stock price had drifted 12.3% lower in the 52 weeks leading up to March, setting investors up for a sharp recovery. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: OLED Universal Display Market Cap $7B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.72%) $1.04 Current Price $145.82 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More No major news from Universal Display? No problem. Here's how this tech developer's stock surged 14% in March anyway. What happened Shares of Universal Display (OLED 0.72%) rose 14.2% in March, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence. The technology developer behind the organic light-emitting diode (OLED) screen you probably have on your phone nowadays didn't have much news of its own to report last month, but the stock was ready to rise on the slightest hint of good news from the mass-market smartphone and high-end TV-set markets. So what Entering March, the stock price had drifted 12.3% lower in 52 weeks. The shares weren't exactly bargain priced, trading at 10 times sales and 31 times adjusted earnings. However, every valuation ratio was dipping deeper than the stock price since Universal Display's sales and profits have been trending up over the last year. The company's financial performance has been stellar in recent years, despite last year's downturn in the all-important target markets of smartphones and OLED-based TV sets. OLED revenue (TTM) data by YCharts. TTM = trailing 12 months. So the stock was looking for any excuse to release more of the market pressure after rising by 25.7% across January and February. As luck would have it, a couple of Universal Display's largest customers had some big news up their sleeves, related to OLED screens. First, the rumor mill churned out some OLED-based Apple (AAPL -0.29%) reports. The low-end iPhone SE 3 currently comes with a high-definition LCD screen, but Cupertino has reportedly ordered OLED screens from a Chinese supplier for the next iteration of this product line. At the other end of the product-pricing spectrum, Apple is said to have its first OLED iPad in the works with a planned price tag of $1,500 and up. For the record, the priciest iPad Pro base model today costs $1,099. On the TV side of the street, the only serious provider of living-room-scale OLED screens to date has been LG Display. So whether your high-end smart TV comes from LG, Sony, TCL, or Vizio, they all get their OLED screens from LG Display's panel-making factories. But that's about to change, as Samsung (SSNL.F) threw its hat into the TV-sized OLED manufacturing ring in mid-March. The larger Korean tech titan will offer a mid-priced range of OLED sets and also start reselling those screens to other TV builders. That's a big step forward in a key market. Now what Don't forget that Universal Display's patent royalties and OLED material sales are based on the total area of screens being sold, so one 55-inch TV screen is worth as much to this company as 100 5.5-inch smartphone screens. As a result, the unit volumes might be lower in this market than in the smartphone sector, but the company should enjoy a game-changing surge in sales and profits as OLED screens work their way toward affordable consumer prices and mass-market appeal. Universal Display has been one of my favorite high-growth tech stocks for years, and nothing has changed in that regard. The stock isn't cheap, but the company's long-term business prospects are downright thrilling. Anders Bylund has positions in Universal Display. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research These Stocks Are Warren Buffett's 3 Largest AI-Fueled Investments By Will Healy – Apr 5, 2023 at 10:00AM Key Points Warren Buffett has offered mixed reviews of artificial intelligence. Berkshire Hathaway owns stock in numerous companies that heavily utilize AI. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.29%) -$0.53 Current Price $183.26 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Berkshire Hathaway's team invested in many ""AI stocks"" -- and not all of them are in the tech sector. Despite the recent optimism and hype surrounding stocks associated with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), AI-focused investment strategies probably don't attract much interest from famed investor Warren Buffett -- at least, not directly. Buffett, who has spoken briefly about both the potential and the drawbacks of these technologies, would likely have less interest in being a direct AI investor. Emerging technologies tend to foster money-losing tech stocks, and history has usually proven him right when he was skeptical of such assets. However, many of the stocks Buffett already owns have made him and the Berkshire Hathaway team into AI investors by default, as many of his smaller investments -- stocks like Amazon, Activision Blizzard, and Snowflake -- make extensive use of the technology. Moreover, three of Berkshire's largest holdings make significant use of AI, and only one would fit the formal definition of a ""tech stock."" 1. Apple Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway did not buy Apple (AAPL -0.29%) for its AI-driven functionality, and AI is not a key reason that Apple now accounts for 44% of the value in the conglomerate's stock portfolio. Nonetheless, AI and ML play roles in enhancing virtually every current product and service offered by Apple. FaceID, voice recognition, and numerous apps are just some of the AI-driven features in its iPhone. Additionally, the company invested heavily in AI and ML research. It funds Apple Scholars, university students who conduct AI research. Also, its AIML Residency Program works with experts across several disciplines. These industry leaders build new AI and ML-driven products and services. While the results of its programs are difficult to predict, they will likely enhance Apple's influence and leadership in the AI industry. With the market's focus on AI increasing, Apple's stock is moving in the right direction. It has risen by more than 30% since the beginning of 2023. The increase in the stock price raised its price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to 28, making it an increasingly expensive company to buy. But as AI's influence over Apple's products and services grows, market-beating returns are probably still within reach for new investors. 2. Bank of America Its name may condition investors to see Bank of America (BAC -0.24%) as a bank, but given its heavy investments in technology, it has arguably evolved into more of a fintech stock. Those tech investments came amid its emergence from the 2008-09 financial crisis, and among the largest banks, it has become a fintech leader. Global Finance named it the ""Most Innovative Digital Bank"" in 2022. On the AI side, BofA describes Erica, its AI-driven assistant, as the engine that brings ""personalized banking"" to its clients. Erica delivers personalized insights and helps monitor accounts, identifying issues such as duplicate charges or changes in spending patterns. Understandably, the liquidity issues that caused the collapses of SVB Financial's Silicon Valley Bank, Silvergate Capital's Silvergate Bank, and others have weighed on the banking sector. Despite BofA's stability, its stock price is down modestly since the beginning of the year. That price drop took its P/E ratio to 9, its lowest level since the beginning of the pandemic. Even though BofA makes up 9% of Berkshire's portfolio, the recent sell-off could be good news for Buffett and other investors. Since the industry's recent troubles do not affect Bank of America directly, now might be an opportune time to buy shares. 3. Chevron Chevron's (CVX 0.77%) growing AI capabilities are probably not prominent among the reasons why Buffett's team has continued to add to its large position in the energy giant. Nonetheless, Chevron accounts for 8% of the value in Berkshire's equity portfolio, and the technology will play at least an indirect role in boosting the value of the oil stock. Today's energy industry relies heavily on technology for various business activities. One area where AI in particular benefits Chevron is data management. To that end, it partnered with Microsoft and UiPath to automate data extraction into back-end systems. Because this process is now being handled automatically, Chevron's business analysts can spend more time on tasks that add more value. Additionally, Chevron applies AI to extract information from drilling reports. The technology can tell researchers how different types of rocks impact a hydrocarbon reservoir. These studies reduce the need to drill exploratory wells, reducing the environmental impact of Chevron's activities. Chevron's stock price is down for 2023, and due to that decline, its P/E ratio of around 9 is in the neighborhood of its multiyear low. Still, the recent announcement by several members of OPEC+ (a group of nations allied with OPEC to cut production in order to boost oil prices) that they will cut crude oil output next month has brought investors back to oil stocks, indicating the stock might soon be heading higher.

However, bears are increasingly concerned about the company's soon-to-be-released VR/AR headset. Success in digital services could mean the company still comes out on top. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.29%) -$0.53 Current Price $183.26 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The company could be headed toward disaster with an upcoming venture into an unproven market. Last year was tough for the tech industry, with countless stocks affected by a sell-off. Some of the world's most valuable companies were hit hard by steep rises in inflation, curbing consumer spending. However, the economically challenging year brought to light the strengths and weaknesses of many businesses. For instance, Apple (AAPL -0.29%) proved its resilience by outperforming many of its peers throughout 2022. Data by YCharts Apple amassed immense brand loyalty over the years thanks to the priority it places on quality and an interconnected product strategy, which promotes ease of use. As a result, its stock offers consistent gains over the long term. However, before investing in this tech giant, you'll want to be aware of both its pros and cons. Here's the bear vs. bull for Apple's stock. Bear: Potential roadblocks when entering a new market In January, Bloomberg reported Apple has plans to launch its first virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset in 2023 after years of speculation. The new device is expected to feature VR and AR capabilities, presented with an iPhone-like interface, and cost around $3,000. However, Apple could face obstacles in succeeding in its new venture amid an uncertain time for the industry. VR has experienced a slight resurgence in recent years, boosted by Meta's Quest line of headsets and its push to grow what it calls the metaverse, or the next version of the internet. As a result, the Facebook owner achieved an 81% market in the VR and AR industry in the fourth quarter of 2022, according to Counterpoint Research. Despite Meta's efforts, however, the technology continues to have low adoption rates from consumers, with Microsoft and Disney recently shuttering their metaverse divisions after seeing a lack of engaging content. Apple has a long history of succeeding when entering new markets, proven by its leading 34.4% market share in headphones after releasing the first AirPods in 2016, despite the presence of established brands such as Bose and Sony. However, the VR/AR market is still in its infancy, with its future largely uncertain. Apple will have its work cut out for it to overcome Meta's dominance and convince consumers to embrace the technology. If any company could succeed in VR/AR, it would likely be Apple. However, if its coming headset doesn't pay off, a failed launch could be detrimental to its stock price. Bull: Apple has a swiftly expanding digital service business Despite potential trouble in its products, Apple's digital services business holds great promise. The company's current services library includes Apple TV+, Music, Fitness+, iCloud, and more, all accessible through a monthly subscription. In fiscal 2022, Apple's services segment earned the second-largest amount of revenue and reported growth of 14%, double the iPhone's 7%. Apple's expansion into digital services allows it to lean less on the success of its products, which can fluctuate quarter to quarter and are more prone to disruptions from economic conditions. Services also offer attractive profit margins, with the segment hitting 71.7% profitability in 2022 while physical products' margins were 36.3%. On March 30, Apple furthered its venture into services by launching its first buy now, pay later (BNPL) program in the U.S., taking on companies like Affirm and Klarna. Named Apple Pay Later, the new program will allow consumers to split purchases costing between $50 and $1,000 over six weeks. Apple Pay Later sees the company using its power in services to boost the sales of its product, which will likely attract more consumers who otherwise would have bought from the competition. Is Apple stock a buy? Apple shares soared 294% in the last five years and 977% in the last ten years. The company has built itself into a tech behemoth, amassing the largest market cap in the world and offering investors consistent gains over the long term. The company may face headwinds in the short term with its coming headset. However, with $20.54 billion in cash and equivalents as of Dec. 30, Apple has the funds and industry dominance to flourish in the long run. Meanwhile, its lucrative services business will likely continue boosting earnings for years. As a result, Apple's stock is a no-brainer buy right now.

In the midst of a banking crisis, historically high interest rates, geopolitical turmoil and heightened recession forecasts, the S&P 500 is up nearly 7% year-to-date. But investors should be wary, warn analysts, because the churn under the surface shows noticeable weakness. The rally that the S&P 500 has enjoyed since the beginning of the year has been driven by a small group of stocks — the market cap of the remaining 480 or so has basically remained the same. “This is not a broad-based rally where all stocks go up but instead a rally concentrated in a few of the largest stocks by market cap, mainly tech names,” Torsten Slok, chief economist at Apollo Global Management, told CNN. Leading the way in growth are tech stocks like Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Tesla (TSLA) and Meta (FB). The collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and stabilizing inflation rates have led to speculation that the Federal Reserve’s painful interest rate hikes could soon come to an end. That’s been a boon to large cap tech stocks that are more sensitive to interest rates because they tend to borrow more than established companies and rely more on the prospect of future earnings. But it also means that the current market rally is thin, as the major indexes outperform the average stock. Nvidia (NVDA), Berkshire Hathaway (BRKA), Visa (V), Exxon Mobil (XOM), UnitedHealth Group (UNH), Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), Walmart (WMT), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Procter & Gamble (PG), Mastercard (MA), Eli Lilly & Co (LLY), Chevron (CVX) and Home Depot (HD) rounded out the list of stocks driving the vast majority of growth in the S&P 500. “The implication for investors is that this market is not driven by broad-based higher growth expectations but instead by what has happened with rates, in particular after [Silicon Valley Bank] went under,” said Slok. Strong outperformance from the largest stocks often power indexes to rise, said Liz Ann Sonders, chief investment strategist at Schwab, in a note Tuesday. But healthy markets should be characterized by greater participation of the “soldiers” — the rest of the stocks, she said. The flight to big tech is also a reaction to an increase in fear and uncertainty by traders, said Patrick Kaser, portfolio manager from Brandywine Global. Market moves this year have come with a “huge undercurrent of skepticism,” Kaser told CNN. As the climate grows more unstable, investors are falling back on the large cap companies that they’ve come to rely on over the past few years. “In these initial stages of uncertainty people do tend to go back to what worked in the last cycle,” he said. “That’s not necessarily a guarantee that those stocks will continue to grow, but it is that comfort food they want to go back to, the Teslas and the other stocks that made easy money in the past.” The tech sector was a popular safe haven for traders during the height of the pandemic. In 2021, the combined yearly revenue of Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Facebook (now Meta) was $1.2 trillion — 25% higher than it was pre-Covid. The bottom line: The market looks really expensive based on traditional valuation metrics, said Kaser. “We’ve had this weird pause over the last three weeks where analysts haven’t been updating earnings estimates because of the banking turmoil. Those are undoubtedly going to come,” he said. “There’s currently a false sense of security that things won’t change, but a lot of the data under the surface is probably pointing towards higher odds of recession. This is not a favorable starting point for stocks as we think about the next few months.” The pound is back The British pound plunged to record lows last year as investors panicked about budget plans by former Prime Minister Liz Truss, but just a few months later Truss is out of office and the pound is back. Sterling hit its highest level against the US dollar in 10 months on Tuesday, topping $1.25 for the first time since June 2022, reports CNN’s Julia Horowitz. The pound, which has advanced about 3.3% versus the greenback since the start of 2023, is currently the best-performing currency among developed economies. So what sparked the rapid turnaround? The UK currency has been boosted by indications the country’s economy is holding up better than expected. Activity is now thought to have expanded 0.1% in the final three months of last year, up from a previous estimate of no growth at all. Gross domestic product growth in January has been estimated at 0.3%, after dropping 0.5% in December. But it’s not all smooth sailing for Brits. This resilience is bolstering expectations the Bank of England will maintain aggressive interest rate hikes despite concerns about the health of the global banking sector. Rising rates can boost the domestic currency because they help attract foreign investors searching for higher returns. Inflation in the United Kingdom also jumped to an annual rate of 10.4% in February, underscoring the need for the Bank of England to maintain its tough approach. ‘I am truly sorry.’ Credit Suisse chairman after bank meltdown Credit Suisse Chairman Axel Lehmann is sorry. The longtime bank executive spent his Tuesday making amends with angry shareholders after the ailing Swiss lender required an emergency rescue last month that left investors nursing heavy losses. “It is a sad day. For all of you, and for us,” Lehmann told 1,748 shareholders at an ice hockey stadium in Zurich at the bank’s last annual meeting as an independent company. CEO Ulrich Körner echoed these remarks, reports CNN’s Hanna Ziady. He said that he shared the disappointment of shareholders, clients, employees and the general public. “What has happened over the past few weeks will continue to affect me personally and many others for a long time to come,” he added. Demonstrators, meanwhile, gathered outside the venue, with some erecting a capsized boat to signify the bank’s demise. Still, Lehmann was narrowly re-elected as board chairman Tuesday. Shareholders also approved all other board directors standing for re-election.

Tech stocks were the key to the Dow being able to post any gain at all. Four tech stock winners were especially important and could keep rising.

Investors had hoped that the stock market would find its footing in 2023 after a tough showing last year. So far, the market has done a reasonably good job of delivering. With the first quarter having come to an end last Friday, major market benchmarks performed well, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC 0.93%) seeing gains of 7% in the first three months of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) hasn't held up as well, managing only to post a gain of less than 1% for the quarter. Yet when you look at the stocks that prevented the Dow from losing ground, you might be surprised to see that they all have one thing in common -- and that thing happens to be exactly what many investors thought would hold them back in 2023. The Dow's top stocks so far in 2023 The one surprising factor in the Dow's rise is that all four of the average's top-performing stocks are in the technology sector. Salesforce.com (CRM -0.75%), Apple (AAPL 1.56%), Intel (INTC 5.52%), and Microsoft (MSFT 1.55%) were the only Dow components to post gains of 20% or more in the first three months of the year. ^DJI data by YCharts The gains for all four of these stocks came amid signs that their respective businesses were resisting macroeconomic pressures better than many had expected. At the beginning of March, Salesforce released financial results that showed that it had seen revenue climb 18% in fiscal 2023, with adjusted earnings rising by 10% to $5.24 per share. Moreover, the customer relationship management software specialist projected that it would see accelerating profit growth in fiscal 2024, with guidance for $7.12 to $7.14 per share in earnings on an adjusted basis. For Apple, sizable gains came late in the period, as investors started to feel more confident about the company's prospects. Worries about the ability to overcome supply chain challenges kept the stock in check for a while, but stock analysts increasingly pointed to signs that demand for its core iPhone line of smartphones remained solid. Moreover, Apple has worked hard to keep costs reined in, and plans to join the virtual revolution with a mixed-reality headset have received a favorable reception. Perhaps the most surprising winner in this set of four was Intel, because the chipmaker has had a lot of trouble executing on its business opportunities. Yet there was new enthusiasm about the potential for Intel to provide vital semiconductors to innovative tech companies seeking to pursue artificial intelligence initiatives. Moreover, with data centers remaining a key component of digital transformation efforts for countless businesses worldwide, longer-term tailwinds for Intel remain in place. Now, Intel just has to take advantage of them. Lastly, Microsoft generated plenty of optimism on the AI front as well, with its key partnership with ChatGPT pioneer OpenAI producing meaningful potential. Combined with its core Office software and Azure cloud infrastructure businesses, Microsoft has put itself in position to capture plenty of growth from some of the most cutting-edge ideas in technology, and it's showing signs of pulling away from some of its oldest rivals in the software arena. Keep watching tech Many market watchers were surprised to see tech climb even as interest rates continued to move higher. Yet with stress in the financial system, investors saw some of these blue chip tech stocks as safe havens, with reliable business performance plus the possibility of future growth. In a tough market environment, such sentiment could help push the Dow still higher in the second quarter of 2023 and beyond. Dan Caplinger has positions in Apple and Microsoft. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple, Microsoft, and Salesforce. The Motley Fool recommends Intel and recommends the following options: long January 2023 $57.50 calls on Intel and long January 2025 $45 calls on Intel. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

[+] European Union (EU) flag on a pc screen. (Photo Illustration by Pavlo Gonchar/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images)SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images Apple stock had a solid year so far rising by about 27% since early January, outperforming the Nasdaq-100 which remains up by about 20% year-to-date. Now, tech stocks in general have fared well this year, following a tough 2022, as cooling inflation and a slowing pace of interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve led investors back to the beaten-down sector. Some other factors have likely helped Apple AAPL stock recently. Apple is making deeper inroads into the financial services space, recently launching a “buy now, pay later” offering that enables Apple Pay users to split payments for purchases over several weeks without incurring interest or fees. Investors are looking ahead to potential new product launches from Apple. Apple is poised to launch a new mixed-reality headset sometime this year. Although the device is likely to be expensive, with volumes expected to be limited at launch, it would mark Apple’s first all-new product launch in almost seven years. The device could also give investors a sense of the company’s plans for computing beyond the smartphone and PC era. Moreover, Apple’s next-generation iPhone due this fall, presumably called the iPhone 15, is likely to feature more pronounced updates. There are expectations that Apple will raise prices on the flagship variants of the device, after essentially keeping prices flat for six years. So, is Apple stock still a buy following the big rally this year? We believe Apple stock is now fully priced. At the current market price of roughly $165 per share, Apple trades at almost 28x consensus FY’23 earnings, which we believe is a relatively high valuation for the company. Apple’s current earnings yields and its position as a safe-haven stock are looking less attractive, with the Federal funds rate standing at between 4.75% to 5.00% presently. Moreover, we have concerns regarding the slowdown in Apple’s services business after years of robust growth. Services revenue grew by just just 6.4% in Q1 FY’23, compared to an average growth rate of over 20% each year over the last five years. This is negative for Apple, considering that services are typically Apple’s highest margin segment (over 70% gross margins compared to about 36% for hardware). We value Apple stock at about $160 per share, marginally below the current market price.

11:04 AM |  9 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Tuesday Market Open) Despite all the geopolitical, banking, and inflation fears, major U.S. indexes continue to climb and entered Tuesday on a four-day winning streak. In many cases, the worst hasn’t come to pass, so fear has slowly leached out of the market, perhaps raising appetites for risk assets.A quiet overnight session brought small gains despite the price of crude oil continuing its ascent following OPEC’s surprise production cut announcement. Crude spiked early yesterday but hasn’t extended those gains too much, and the decision caused some head-scratching ahead of what many analysts expect to be rising demand from China as it reopens.Energy shares led the way Monday as Wall Street began the week on a green note, and many overseas markets followed suit earlier Tuesday. Focus today is likely to be on the Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS) data due soon after the open (more below).We’re a few days into Q2 and there’s still a buzz over the S&P 500® index’s (SPX) Q1 strength. It rose 7% in the quarter, and analysts were quick to point out Monday that, in past years when the SPX climbed in Q1 following losses the year before, it ended up extending the positive trend.Something to keep in mind, though, is that much of the SPX’s gains in Q1 came courtesy of a handful of very large stocks that can have outsized influence on the index due to their heavy weighting. As Schwab Chief Investment Strategist Liz Ann Sonders notes in her latest commentary, the 10 largest stocks in the SPX were responsible for 90% of the index’s Q1 increase, with the triumvirate of Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) contributing more than 50%.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) rose 3 basis points to 3.46%. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) slipped to 102.02. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures edged up to 18.82. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) rose to $81.14 per barrel. Volatility popped a bit early yesterday as crude prices soared on news of OPEC’s production cut, but VIX didn’t make it to 20. VIX remains near the March lows, hinting that traders don’t expect dramatic moves in stocks anytime soon.Just InPerhaps OPEC knows what it’s doing. That could be the takeaway when you consider the cartel’s surprise cut to crude production over the weekend preceded Monday data releases showing continued struggles for two of the world’s key economies. Both U.S. and China manufacturing activity came in below expectations in separate reports, reinforcing ideas that slowing demand for manufactured goods conceivably could lower crude oil demand, as well.The March Caixin China General Manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index fell to 50.0, right on the cusp of levels that would indicate retraction, and below the consensus view collected by Trading Economics. This raises new questions about how quickly China’s recovering from COVID-19 shutdowns.Then the U.S. March Institute for Supply Management (ISM) Manufacturing Index fell to 46.3, the lowest since May 2020. Deeper in the report, drops in new orders and prices signaled more weakness, with almost every component declining in March from February’s readings. This is the fifth straight month of declining U.S. manufacturing activity, providing more ammunition to analysts predicting a recession.How did the stock and Treasury markets react to yesterday’s soft U.S. manufacturing data? By jumping quickly to intraday highs, though stocks quickly gave back their gains. The “bad news is good news” hypothesis still appears to hold water, with investors hoping weak data means less pressure on the Fed to continue tightening. The 2-year Treasury yield—generally seen as quite sensitive to interest rates—fell below 4% right around the time the ISM data hit the tape.Today’s job openings data could provide more clues for the Treasury markets. Any sign of tightening (fewer job openings) would probably help ease inflation concerns even more, possibly underpinning Treasury note values and lowering yields (which move opposite of the underlying note). That report is due at 10 a.m. ET.Job Openings and Labor Turnover Survey (JOLTS): The latest update comes right after the market opens today. This report’s been swollen for months, hovering close to 11 million. However, the headline number fell by 400,000 in January to 10.8 million. Analysts expect another drop, albeit to a level that’s still historically high near 10.4 million, according to Trading Economics.Stocks in SpotlightJP Morgan Chase’s (JPM) influential CEO Jamie Dimon said in a letter to shareholders today that while the current U.S. banking crisis is “nothing like 2008,” it isn’t clear when the crisis will end. He thinks it could bring tighter financial conditions as banks get more conservative, but isn’t sure if that will have an impact on consumer spending.Walmart’s (WMT) investor meeting runs today and tomorrow, putting the focus on any observations company executives have about their current fiscal quarter after they offered soft guidance back in February. Back then, the company said high prices and weak demand for discretionary items were potential headwinds. Other retailers like Home Depot (HD) concurred in their own earnings reports at the time.One thing in WMT’s favor, however, could be a dynamic where shoppers gravitate toward lower-cost retailers when economic growth slows. Perhaps the company can shed light on whether this is happening, which might offer investors a sense of general consumer sentiment.Fries with that? If people are trying to save money, you’d think that would help a fast-food outlet like McDonald’s (MCD). Investors seem to think so, anyway, as shares of MCD went on a roll (or should we say a bun) in late March. Now the company is preparing corporate layoffs, according to the Wall Street Journal, though MCD won’t say how many people will receive pink slips. MCD reduced its headcount by about 30,000 between 2017 and 2019, the paper reported. Generally, most recent layoff announcements have been in the tech sector. The question now is whether MCD is the tip of the iceberg for retail sector layoffs.Eye on the FedRecent data, including yesterday’s ISM manufacturing and last Friday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) prices both came in below expectations, but this doesn’t necessarily mean the Fed is much less likely to raise rates next month. The next meeting is four weeks away, and a lot can happen between now and then. For a pause to start looking more feasible, we’d probably need to see data that doesn’t simply fall short of expectations. It likely needs to be significantly below expectations, considering the Fed’s focus on fighting inflation. Rising gas prices in the wake of the OPEC oil production cut could simply make the Fed even more wary of any data that suggest more price pressure. Market participants seem aware of this, as the futures market continues to price in better than 60% probability of a 25-basis-point hike in early May, according to the CME FedWatch Tool, despite recent signs of slowness in the data. One wildcard: Layoffs. These aren’t in the realm of “data” per se but can come at any time. Eventually, layoffs do show up in the data, typically in the form of new jobless claims. That number has been very low almost all year, but if layoffs pick up, we could see that change—and the Fed is likely to take notice. What to WatchJobs update: A few days out from the March Nonfarm Payrolls report, here’s how analyst estimates shape up, according to Trading Economics: Jobs growth: 240,000, down from 311,000 in February but still historically high. Hourly wage growth: 0.3%, up from 0.2% in February. Unemployment rate: 3.6%, unchanged from February. Participation rate: 62.5%, unchanged from February. If participation rises, that would likely be read as a positive sign of a tightening labor market that could help cool inflation. It inched up in February and the unemployment rate rose slightly. That may seem contradictory, but the Labor Department doesn’t count non-participants in the job market—those who are neither working nor looking for work—when it calculates the headline unemployment rate.Out of Breadth: Just 10 large stocks accounted for most of the SPX’s gains in Q1. This isn’t the kind of broad and deep rally that bullish investors like to see.

Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investWhat drove crude cut? OPEC’s decision to trim crude production by more than 1 million barrels per day over the weekend surprised the market, but recent price action should probably have provided clues. Many of the largest members of the cartel find it hard to profit at prices below $80 per barrel, according to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), so the recent dive to near $70 for Brent crude—a 15-month low—probably raised profitability concerns.Less competition: In the past, OPEC was sometimes hesitant to cut production too much, fearing the resulting higher prices might cause U.S. producers to increase their own output and flood the market. That doesn’t seem to be the case these days, as U.S. production remains about half a million barrels per day below the 2019 peak of 13 million, and many major oil companies have expressed hesitance to drill more, according to a survey last year by the Dallas Fed. The recent banking issues could make U.S. crude even less of a concern for OPEC, causing problems for smaller U.S. oil producers trying to finance increased production.Recession clue? The final straw for OPEC might have been last month’s U.S. and European banking industry issues, which economists say raised demand concerns. OPEC doesn’t want to pump crude if it’s not going to be immediately used, perhaps still haunted by images of oil barges at sea with nowhere to go in the spring of 2020, when front-month U.S. crude futures briefly fell below zero during the pandemic. In a sense, the weekend production cut is another bet, this time by OPEC, on the global economy slowing down.CalendarApril 5: February Trade Balance and March ISM Non-Manufacturing Index.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research PayPal Near Its Cheapest Valuation Over the Past 10 Years -- Is It a Buy? By Rob Starks Jr – Apr 4, 2023 at 7:00AM Key Points Investors worry about the company's revenue growth and increasing competition in this weak economic environment. PayPal's profits should recover once e-commerce growth resumes. Its valuation is near its lowest since the company separated from eBay. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: PYPL PayPal Market Cap $71B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (0.14%) $0.09 Current Price $63.82 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:31 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Investors have lost enthusiasm for investing in this money transfer company over the last year and a half. PayPal (PYPL 0.14%) started the year by rising 24% to an intraday high of $88.63 on Feb. 2, as many optimistic investors believed the Federal Reserve was close to ending its relentless rate hikes and the economy could achieve a soft landing -- an excellent scenario for this business. However, investors lost interest in the company after subsequent events showed the chances were high the economy would instead have a hard landing, a sharp economic slowdown. As a result, investors worry about a further deterioration in PayPal's revenue growth. Now that today's stock price is closer to where it started the year, should you use the pullback in the stock's price to buy, or should you sit on the sidelines and wait until the danger of recession has passed? Let's take a look at that question. The top dog in e-commerce payments PayPal started in 1998 and was among the first to market payment services between merchants and consumers in the then-emerging e-commerce industry. Thus, it established strong brand recognition and customer loyalty well before significant competition appeared. Additionally, because it operates on both sides of the payment transaction, it enjoys a two-sided network effect. The value the consumer gains from using its network is determined by how many merchants accept payments from PayPal. Conversely, the number of consumers who use the payment service determines the platform's worth for merchants. Thus, the value of the payment platform increases with each new consumer or merchant joining the network. PayPal used these two competitive advantages to increase its total payment volume through its platform to $1.36 trillion in fiscal 2022 -- making it a powerful global payments platform. As of September 2022, PayPal is the No. 1 player in the online payments industry, with a market share of about 42%, according to market research company Statista. Considering the company's dominance in online payments, it makes you wonder why investors have abandoned the stock over the past 18 months or so. A poor economic environment and increased competition Growth investors familiar with seeing the company producing double-digit percentage revenue growth started aggressively selling their shares in late 2021 into 2022 as revenue growth began its steep fall into the single digits, as shown in the following chart. PYPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Data source: YCharts Quarterly reports over the past year have not helped investors feel better about the company. For instance, its fourth-quarter 2022 results continued to show several deteriorating key metrics, despite the headlines of revenue and earnings beating analysts' expectations. For example, the growth of active accounts, defined as registered PayPal accounts that completed a transaction over its network within the last 12 months, slowed to a crawl, showing only 2% growth compared to the previous year's 13% year-over-year growth. In addition, TPV showed a sharp deceleration from 23% year-over-year growth in the fourth quarter of 2021 to a measly 5% in the fourth quarter of 2022 -- yikes! No wonder revenue growth fell off a cliff. Management has blamed the deterioration of active accounts, TPV, and revenue on multiple factors, including a weaker macro economy and slowing e-commerce growth. Investors have also recently been displeased with the company's operating margins, thinking a savvy management team and its competitive advantages would build a moat around PayPal's profitability. Yet, operating margins began deteriorating starting in July 2021, as seen in the chart below (though they've rebounded some in the past few quarters). PYPL Operating Margin (Quarterly) data by YCharts Many believe PayPal's deteriorating fundamentals have causes beyond just a cyclical downturn. The company's competitive advantages may have eroded, resulting in it spending more to stave off its adversaries, which decreases operating margins. On the merchant side, PayPal faces competition from companies like Stripe, and on the consumer side, platforms like Apple Pay are chipping away at its payment dominance. Shareholders also worry about Block competing on both sides of the payment transaction, with Square on the merchant side and Cash App on the consumer side. Why you should put PayPal on your buy list Despite the competition, PayPal is still the lead dog and a preferred only payments partner. Revenue growth probably will recover once e-commerce growth rebounds -- but when that occurs is anyone's guess. The good news is that this management team has focused on things it can control, which is cutting costs in areas not producing enough bang for the buck while fully staffing and funding the most productive areas of the company to pursue profitable growth. PayPal is already seeing progress in its cost-cutting initiatives, resulting in its non-GAAP (generally accepted accounting principles) operating margin widen by 115 basis points year over year to 22.9%, up sequentially for two straight quarters. Meanwhile, it continues to invest in its most-promising growth initiatives like the modernization of the checkout experience; scaling growth at Braintree, a PayPal-owned payments processor; and fully ramping up its unbranded service to small and mid-sized businesses. The unbranded service is its checkout technology that appears on a third-party merchant's website without displaying the PayPal button. PayPal today trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.12, hovering near its lowest valuation since its separation from eBay in 2015. Suppose you believe PayPal's revenue growth will bounce back to double digits percentages once the global economy improves and e-commerce growth rebounds. Through continued cost control, the company should achieve solid margins and increase profits rapidly, making today's valuation look mighty tempting to an investor. And it would be a great time to grab a few shares of this undervalued stock. Rob Starks Jr has positions in Block. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple, Block, and PayPal.

It currently produces a relatively small amount of revenue and huge operating losses. Most of those operating expenses aren't going toward existing products, though. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: META Meta Platforms Market Cap $695B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.09%) $2.95 Current Price $274.00 Price as of June 13, 2023, 9:30 a.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Investors should expect another big year of metaverse-related investment in 2023. Meta Platforms (META 1.09%) has invested tens of billions into developing virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) technology without much to show for it in terms of a viable new business segment. That could start to change next year. While management plans to continue its outsized investments in the Reality Labs segment, management plans to keep investments in line with overall revenue growth starting in 2024 and beyond. ""We expect to pace Reality Labs investments to ensure that we can achieve our goal of growing overall company operating income,"" CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's third-quarter earnings call in October. An indication of improving profitability in Reality Labs could give investors confidence that Zuckerberg's massive bet will finally pay off. Meta reported big costs, little revenue Reality Labs is currently generating massive operating losses with inconsistent revenue. Meta had a hit with the Oculus Quest 2, but sales dropped in 2023. Image source: The Motley Fool. Data source: Meta Platforms. The fourth-quarter revenue decline indicates the market for virtual reality headsets remains relatively limited. Meta and other companies in the VR/AR space have work to do in order to expand the market. That could come with a new wave of product announcements in the near future from several companies, including Apple (AAPL 1.56%). Apple is reportedly developing its own AR/VR headset with a potential release later this year. Apple's entry into a category has historically given the entire industry a boost. The meager revenue from the segment barely makes a dent in Meta's operating expenses. Reality Labs produced operating losses of $13.7 billion and $10.2 billion in 2022 and 2021, respectively. The net effect on operating margin for 2022 was nearly 12.5 percentage points. What's driving those massive losses? The biggest thing driving losses in Reality Labs is Meta's investments in augmented reality technology. There are three areas of investment within Reality Labs: Virtual reality products like its Oculus lineup, metaverse software development like Horizon Worlds, and augmented reality technology, none of which has shipped. In fact, Zuckerberg says augmented reality research and development is the biggest expense in the segment. Indeed, augmented reality could be a much bigger market than virtual reality. The potential for technology to overlay information in the real world (AR) is much more appealing for many than immersing yourself in a separate virtual world (VR). There are likely many more uses, too. VR may be just a stepping stone to AR. To that end, Meta's spending on Reality Labs isn't going to slow down. ""We're going to continue to invest meaningfully in this area given the significant long-term opportunities that we see. It is a long-duration investment,"" CFO Susan Li said on Meta's Q4 earnings call. Managing for operating profit growth There are two ways Meta can improve operating profits while increasing its investments in AR research and the rest of Reality Labs: Reaccelerate growth in the advertising business, or start producing meaningful revenue from the Reality Labs segment. The former is very likely going to happen. Meta is investing heavily in artificial intelligence to overcome the challenges it faces in tracking ad performance following Apple's introduction of App Tracking Transparency in iOS 14. It's showing improvements in Reels monetization as well, which has become a significant source of ad inventory, displacing some higher-value inventory in Feed and Stories. The outlook for the ads business is very positive. The latter, however, remains a real possibility. As Meta brings its AR technology to market through smartphone and headset devices, it should be able to make headway in expanding the market and producing real revenue within the segment. 2024 will be the year to watch to see improvements in profitability for Reality Labs. In the meantime, patient investors should be rewarded as the advertising business rebounds, making Meta shares a great way to invest in the potential of augmented reality.

Comparing the historical outlook and ongoing trends of this market The Global IoT in Healthcare Market is expected to garner significant returns over the assessment timeline of 2022-2029. The breakout of the Coronavirus pandemic created profitable prospects for this business vertical. Increasing infection rates led to a rapid rise in the patient pool, which in turn created a massive shortage of healthcare equipment as well as professionals to ensure the effective treatment of all the patients. Apart from that, patients suffering from other ailments were reluctant to visit healthcare centres due to contamination risks. This increased the adoption of IoT based healthcare devices which could facilitate remote health consulting and other activities. IoT technologies further enabled healthcare professionals to constantly monitor a patient's health status remotely. These factors together stimulated the dynamics of this industry sphere during the pandemic era. Increasing health awareness among the masses is another crucial development stimulant for this market sphere. This has been a growing trend of self-health management wherein individuals are keen about monitoring their health and take efficient preventive measures in case of any abnormalities. It is impossible for people to physically visit healthcare centers frequently to monitor their health. This has given rise to the popularity of remote health monitoring devices including wearables. With the help of these devices and technologies people can easily monitor their health based on various parameters. This in turn is adding traction to the overall growth of this industry vertically.

Gurman Weighs In On One Strategy That Could Help Cupertino Win Big In This Frontierby Shanthi Rexaline, Benzinga Editor May 7, 2023 4:33 PM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsApple's iPhone resurgence during the last quarter was fueled by emerging markets.Although making the iPhone cheaper could be bad for Apple's brand image, it could help rope in consumers into Apple's ecosystem, Gurman saidApple, Inc. AAPL reported last week results for its fiscal year second quarter that beat forecasts. One message that stood out during the company management’s earnings call was an emphasis on ""emerging markets.""What Happened: While Apple CEO Tim Cook's focus on emerging markets wasn't surprising, the number of times the topic was mentioned during the call was higher than expected, Bloomberg columnist Mark Gurman said in his weekly “Power On” newsletter.India alone was mentioned about 20 times on the call, Gurman noted.The iPhone’s resurgence during the quarter was fueled by emerging markets across South Asia, the Middle East and Latin America, Gurman said, citing Apple CFO Luca Maestri.In Apple's more established markets, however, sales fell in the Americas, Japan and China, contributing to an overall revenue decline of about 3%, the columnist said.""The message from Apple is that there's still plenty of room to expand in these newer markets and add customers to its platform,"" Gurman said. He noted that Maestri had mentioned during the call that, in regions where Apple's market share is low, the company tends to add a lot of new customers to its ecosystem.Gurman also pointed out that Cook had said that India is at a ""tipping point,"" where a lot of people  are entering the middle class and could be convinced to buy iPhones. See Also: Everything You Should Know About Apple StockSuper Cheap iPhones Not On Radar: The Apple CEO's comments on India suggests that the company is waiting for Indian consumers to purchase Apple products at standard prices, Gurman said. He added that Apple may not necessarily make super-cheap iPhones in order to penetrate the Indian market.In making his case, Gurman mentioned that two new Apple locations in India are upscale stores, with the same premium-priced products and services seen in other countries.Apple has avoided bringing down the price of its products because it believes that doing so could hurt its brand and profit margins, Gurman said. ""But selling cheaper devices could get more people to buy Apple services, one of the company's few categories that grew last quarter,"" he added.While Apple might not ever release a new iPhone under $300, it could market its older SE models as cheaper alternatives, Gurman said. Apple closed Friday’s session up 4.69% at $173.57, according to Benzinga Pro data.Read Next: Can Tesla Beat Apple In Market Value?

Benzinga Staff Writer May 7, 2023 2:01 PM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsApple's last major series of layoffs occurred in 1997, when co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company.Last week, Apple reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year. Amid an economic downturn and layoffs across tech industries, Apple Inc AAPL CEO Tim Cook reiterated that mass layoffs are not part of the company's current plans. Speaking with CNBC last week, Cook said that he views mass layoffs as ""a last resort"" and that they are not being discussed. ""We're continuing to hire, just at a lower clip level than we were before. And we're doing all the right things by challenging the things we spend, and we're just finding a few more ways to save on it,"" Cook said. The Apple CEO, however, didn't rule out the possibility of job cuts while noting that the company is ""continuing to be extremely prudent on hiring.""Earlier in February, Cook said in an interview with The Wall Street Journal that there are ways to reduce costs without turning to mass layoffs. ""I view layoffs as a last resort kind of thing,"" Cook said. ""You can never say never. We want to manage costs in other ways to the degree we can."" Also Read: Tim Cook Shares The One Thing He's Copied From Steve Jobs As Apple's CEO: 'He Expected It Everywhere In The Company'Apple's last major series of layoffs occurred in 1997, when co-founder Steve Jobs returned to the company and Apple, in turn, cut costs by firing 4,100 employees.During the pandemic, the company added employees at a much slower rate than other tech companies. It also ""tends to run lean,"" with limited employee perks and businesses focused on hardware products, The Wall Street Journal reported. Last week, Apple reported better-than-expected earnings for the second quarter of the 2023 fiscal year. The company's earnings per share came in at $1.52, beating the consensus estimate of $1.43 per share, while revenue totaled $94.8 billion, compared to analysts' forecast of $92.96 billion.Now Read: Here Is What Apple CEO Tim Cook Plans To Do Before Stepping DownPhoto: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

The S&P 500 index SPX has largely moved sideways over the past few weeks, as markets try to stomach concerns about a brittle regional-banking ecosystem and the Federal Reserve’s efforts to navigate the economy through rising prices and past the threat of a recession. But more of the companies that make up that index are turning out stronger-than-normal results. “At this late stage of the Q1 2023 earnings season, S&P 500 companies are recording their best performance relative to analyst expectations since Q4 2021,” FactSet senior earnings analyst John Butters said in a report Friday. “Both the number of companies reporting positive EPS surprises and the magnitude of these earnings surprises are above their 10-year averages.” The fourth quarter of 2021 was when markets started to turn sour, and Wall Street’s expectations were subdued heading into the first quarter of this year. Still, with 85% of S&P 500 companies having reported quarterly results so far, 79% of those have reported per-share profit topping Wall Street’s expectations. That’s above the 10-year average of 73%.  The results so far represent a 2.2% earnings decline for the quarter, according to the FactSet report. If they hold, they would mark the second straight quarter where per-share profits fell, and the predicted earnings recession. But that 2.2% figure is better than expectations for a 6.7% earnings drop that Wall Street expected for the first quarter at the end of March.  Companies in the Information Technology sector helped lead the charge for those better-than-expected first-quarter results. Butters said that within that sector, results from Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Intel INTC were “substantial contributors” to mitigating that sector’s decline in earnings.  “As a result, the blended earnings decline for the Information Technology sector improved to -10.6% from -15.1% over this period,” Butters said.  Elsewhere, results from Amazon AMZN, Ford Motor Co. F and General Motors Co. GM have buoyed the results of consumer discretionary companies. Butters said that results from those companies helped push the blended earnings growth rate for that segment — or actual results combined with estimated ones for companies that still have to report — to 53.6% from 33.8%. The swings underscore the tech giants’ outsize influence on quarterly earnings and the index overall, as those companies look for firmer footing after the pandemic led to an explosion in digital demand that later faded.  Apple’s results benefited from a surprise gain in iPhone sales, while Microsoft’s bolder-than-anticipated forecast lifted its stock following strong sales gains in its cloud business. Intel still reported a massive loss, but the results overall surpassed estimates. Amazon’s results also beat estimates. However, the stock took a hit after its chief financial officer warned of a slowdown in cloud revenue. This week in earnings For the week ahead, 32 S&P 500 companies will report quarterly results, including one from the Dow Jones Industrial Average, Walt Disney Co. DIS. Videogame companies are some of the most prominent this week, with developer Electronic Arts Inc. EA following up layoffs and disappointing results while executives decide whether to delay or pull the plug on some game releases. Also due this week is Roblox Corp. RBLX and monetization engines Unity Software Inc. U and AppLovin Corp. APP. Also on the docket are Tyson Foods Inc. TSN, as customers look for more relief at the grocery store from price increases that helped boost the food industry’s sales and profit. Fast-food chains Wendy’s Co. WEN and Krispy Kreme Inc. DNUT also report, amid some signs that restaurants might back off of similar price increases, but other signs that restaurant prices haven’t eased as much as grocery prices.  Robinhood Markets Inc. HOOD and Beyond Meat Inc. BYND also report quarterly results. Charles Schwab Corp. SCHW is also set to report April monthly activity as well. The calls to put on your calendar Lots of media companies, lots of distress: Hollywood writers are on strike for the first time in some 15 years, threatening to grind production to a halt. Digital-media outlets that were once the envy of the industry are reckoning with layoffs and closures after years of aggressive growth. Executive commentary on earnings calls during the week — from the likes of Disney, Endeavor Group Holdings Inc. EDR, BuzzFeed Inc. BZFD and the New York Times Co. NYT — could address what the industry might look like ahead after steep retrenchments.   Those results will arrive as investors shift their focus from growth to profitability after a decade’s worth of chasing news traffic and streaming subscriptions. Following the explosion of digital demand during the pandemic, more questions have also been raised over how much the digital economy values, or devalues, the writers and reporters at its foundation. The results from BuzzFeed and the New York Times will follow the shutdown of BuzzFeed news and the cancellation of “Vice News Tonight,” layoffs at outlets like Vice Media and Insider, and a widening financial divide between the biggest news sites and smaller ones. While shares of BuzzFeed have plunged 88.4% over the past 12 months, New York Times’ shares are up 11.7% over that period.  While it still depends on the craziness of election cycles for subscribers, the New York Times consists of its namesake news outlet, Wirecutter and the Athletic, as well as games and recipes. But even as consumers grow more cautious on spending, JPMorgan analysts recently said they were expecting the company to raise its prices.  “The decision to take price on news we think reflects NYT’s confidence not only in the stand-alone value of its product — even in a period of economic softness — but also in its bundle strategy, as some subscribers may opt for All-Access because of the relative value,” the analysts said in a note in March.  Meanwhile, results from Disney and Endeavor — Hollywood mogul Ari Emanuel’s entertainment conglomerate — could yield more detail on how both companies are navigating a potentially larger work stoppage, after the union representing TV and film writers went on strike following an impasse with studios over pay and protections for streaming and concerns about being replaced with AI. Disney CEO Robert Iger will have even more issues to discuss, including dueling lawsuits with the state of Florida and layoffs that have been rippling through the media giant.The number to watch PayPal and consumer spending: Payments platform PayPal Holdings Inc. PYPL reports quarterly results on Monday, ahead of leadership changes at the top and in-limbo online spending. The results will be a proxy for consumer spending overall, after e-commerce demand surged and then faded through the pandemic.  Earnings Outlook: PayPal seems on track to ‘clear a low bar.’ Is that enough to help its stock? PayPal could also face more questions about its future during its earnings call, after Chief Executive Dan Schulman in February said he planned to retire from the company at the end of the year. BofA analysts, in a research note last month, said further detail on Schulman’s successor in the months ahead would be a key focal point, after the stock, a steady gainer for years, shed a good chunk of those increases in 2021. The analysts added that “we continue to believe that tech product development / deployment needs to be a core skill set of the new leader.” This article has been updated to clarify that Charles Schwab is set to report monthly activity this week.

Got it!Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinWennie Wen of New York City poses for photos in the exhibition hall of the Berkshire Hathaway annual ... [+] meeting on Saturday, May 6, 2023, in Omaha, Neb. (AP Photo/Rebecca S. Gratz)Copyright 2023 The Associated Press. All rights reserved Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK/A, BRK/B) annual “Woodstock for Capitalists” was held on May 6th. After last year’s attendance was below recent years, it was a packed house on Saturday. Warren Buffett, CEO and Chairman, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman, answered questions from shareholders for over five hours. Greg Abel and Ajit Jain joined in answering questions for the first part of the meeting. After the traditional movie to open the meeting, featuring Jaime Lee Curtis this year, Buffett briefly reviewed first-quarter earnings. He provided the closest thing to earnings guidance that he has ever uttered. Buffett noted that it is a “different climate than it was six months ago,” so the majority of Berkshire’s businesses are likely to have lower earnings in 2023 than the previous year. The good news is that higher yields should lead to higher investment income in 2023, and insurance underwriting does not “correlate with economic activity.” In other words, the insurance businesses should do better than in 2022. With the tailwind from the insurance segment, Buffett expects Berkshire’s 2023 operating earnings to be better than last year. As one would expect, given the recent banking failures, the pair was asked multiple questions about the U.S. banking system. Buffett summarized the challenge of a bank crisis by saying that “fear is contagious, always.” In a rare move, he directly criticized some of the banking practices of the failed First Republic Bank (FRC). Buffett mentioned that First Republic offered non-government guaranteed jumbo mortgages, and the “world ignored it until it blew up.” While he gave his opinion that the depositors at U.S. banks are safe even beyond the FDIC guarantee, he wouldn’t commit to how regional bank shareholders would fare. Munger summarized the situation in his classic style, adding that “a bunch of bankers trying to get rich doesn’t lead to good things.” Buffett took the opportunity to contrast banking with Berkshire’s insurance business. The insurance business produces float, created by the premiums paid by those purchasing insurance. The insurance company gets to invest the float until the insurance claims are made. In addition, unlike bank deposits, the float can’t be withdrawn and doesn’t earn any interest. Buffett said, “It’s like having a bank with no employees, no interest, and no ability to withdraw the money in a hurry.” Berkshire’s float is now approximately $165 billion, an increase of roughly $1 billion year-to-date. Buffett did say that “banks can be a perfectly good investment.” He noted that in addition to owning banks in Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio, Berkshire had a wholly-owned bank at one time with plans to acquire more before legislation forced them to sell it. Buffett typically refrains from giving much detail about Berkshire’s publicly traded stock holdings but spoke about Occidental Petroleum (OXY). According to Bloomberg, Berkshire is Occidental Petroleum’s largest shareholder, with a 23.6% stake. Buffett said he doesn’t know what the price of oil will be, but he likes Occidental Petroleum’s position in the Permian basin and management. He left the door open that Berkshire could purchase more shares but said it would stop short of making an offer to control the company. Here are more details about the possible reasons for Berkshire’s investment in Occidental Petroleum. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor When asked about the possibility of future dividends, Buffett noted that Berkshire paid a dividend once, which was a mistake. He said Berkshire could distribute cash in a significant way via stock buybacks if the stock became undervalued. In addition, he would prefer to have the money on hand to make substantial acquisitions if any attractive targets became available. For those worried about the stock dropping precipitously when Buffett and Munger can no longer manage the firm, Buffett’s statement that Berkshire “will buy $50 billion of our stock if it makes sense” should provide some comfort. Share repurchases accelerated in the first quarter, as Berkshire bought back $4.4 billion of stock. When asked about the prudence of Apple (AAPL), comprising over 35% of Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio, Buffett noted that Apple was not 35% of Berkshire’s portfolio because the firm has many wholly owned subsidiaries. He added that a previous sale of Apple shares was done partially for tax reasons but was “still a mistake.” He went on to say that Apple was a “better business than any we own.” Munger chimed in on the subject with a more direct response that we “ignore most notions of our experts about de-worsification of portfolios.” Here is more analysis of Berkshire’s publicly traded stock portfolio. Lastly, when answering a question about the opportunities for value investing in an era of disruptive technology, Munger argues that value investors will have a more challenging time now that so many intelligent people are competing for the same opportunities. Buffett was more optimistic that there would be “plenty of opportunities.” He believes technology has continuously changed, but human nature remains the same. Buffett said that opportunities come from “other people doing dumb things,” and they will continue to do more dumb things in the future.

Despite its advantages, Wall Street's obsession with short-term performance is arguably its biggest weakness. There are plenty of opportunities for individual value investors in today's market.

Learn More Buffett and Munger share words of caution and optimism at Berkshire Hathaway's annual shareholder meeting. Warren Buffett got his start by investing in small, unknown companies for less than they were worth. A lot has changed in the decades since, and Buffett has repeatedly said that many of those easy opportunities have long been lost due to a far more sophisticated and informed market. During Berkshire Hathaway's (BRK.A -0.36%) (BRK.B -0.50%) annual shareholders meeting on Saturday, Buffett's right-hand man, Charlie Munger, had a warning to investors. ""I think value investors are going to have a harder time now that there's so many of them competing for a diminished bunch of opportunities. So my advice to value investors is to get used to making less,"" Munger said. But before you despair, consider this piece of good news: Buffett believes that short-term thinking and dumb ideas are running more rampant than ever. Investors who combat these impulses with patience can gain an edge over Wall Street. Here's what Munger and Buffett said about value investing at the annual meeting -- and how their lessons could help you make wise investment decisions. Image source: The Motley Fool. Opportunities occur when people do dumb things Because Berkshire is so big now, Buffett and Munger can't benefit much from investing in traditional hidden gems. Instead, they have to focus more on finding high-quality companies and letting those investments compound over time. Yet value investors around the world still look up to them for their ability to identify what Buffett would call ""a wonderful business at a fair price."" Today's media landscape has more voices preaching fast and easy money. There are plenty of dangerous yet enviable success stories built on a house of lucky cards. Buffett believes that part of the problem is that it is easier for people to get the capital needed to pitch an idea or pursue a bad business plan. When these businesses go public, their financials or path to profitability can be cloudy at best. This presents a challenge for investors that have to filter out the noise and determine if a prospective growth stock can bridge the gap between expectations and reality. On Saturday, Buffett said: New things coming along don't take away the opportunities. What gives you opportunities is other people doing dumb things. And I would say that the 58 years we've been running Berkshire, I would say there's been a great increase in the number of people doing dumb things, and they do big dumb things. And the reason they do it to some extent is because they can get money from other people so much easier than when we started. Buffett believes he could do well if he were just starting out in today's market by simply ignoring Wall Street's short-term focus and identifying opportunities based on long-term fundamentals: The world is overwhelmingly short-term focused. And if you go to an investor relations call ... the management is interested in feeding them expectations that will slightly be beaten. That is a world that is made to order for anybody that's trying to think about what to do that should work over five, or ten, or twenty years. And I just think that I'd love to be born today, and go out with not too much money and hopefully turn it into a lot of money. When Buffett was first starting out, the greatest advantage a value investor could have was access to information. Today, with information beyond the young Buffett's dreams available without much effort, the greatest advantage is the ability to ignore distractions and the discipline to maintain a long-term time horizon. Focusing on what matters most Buffett's disdain for speculative gambles and big companies taking advantage of smaller players has been an ongoing narrative for several years. However, Buffett did provide a reassuring comment for investors that are managing less capital -- such as individual investors. I think that investing has disappeared so much from this huge capitalistic market, that anybody can play in, but the big money is in selling other people ideas that aren't outperforming. And I think that if you don't if you don't run too much money, which we do, but if you're running small amounts of money, I think the opportunities will be greater. But then Charlie and I have always differed on this subject, he likes to tell me how gloomy the world is and I like to tell him, ""We'll find something,"" and so far we've both been kind of right. One of the biggest advantages of being an individual investor is that your results aren't measured against peers. All that matters is that you achieve your financial goals. Financial goals and aligning your personal risk tolerance with your investment allocation matter much more than beating the market in a given year or two. Taking advantage of Wall Street's short-term focus Despite Buffett's steadfast optimism toward the individual value investor, both Buffett and Munger agreed that investing is far harder today than when they first got their start. Munger said the following during the annual meeting: There is so much money in the hands of so many smart people, all trying to outsmart one another, and outgrow one another, getting more money out of other people. And it's a radically different world from the world we started in, and I suppose it will have its opportunities, but it's also going to have some unpleasant episodes. In the pursuit of outsmarting each other, Wall Street can often drastically overvalue or undervalue a stock in the short term -- which can lead to generational wealth for long-term investors. Berkshire has a history of taking advantage of mispriced assets, whether it's swooping in to invest in distressed financial institutions or its relatively recent success with Apple. Buffet and his team began buying Apple stock during a time when its price to earnings ratio was around 12 and Wall Street was skeptical its ability to scale with services revenue. Fast forward to Apple's latest quarter, and it's notched a staggering $20.9 billion just in services revenue -- an all-time high for the segment. A vote of confidence for individual investors It's easy to get discouraged by Wall Street's influence and the growing sophistication of public markets. But if the past few years have taught us anything, it's that markets are more sensitive than ever to short-term performance. It can feel like a lot to handle: the wild price swings of 2020, the tech boom of 2021, the steep sell-off of 2022, and the gradual recovery of 2023. But zoom out, and the volatility for high-quality companies was ultimately just noise. So while the competition on Wall Street may be more intense than ever before, there's a good argument that individual value investors can still do quite well in the stock market so long as they stay principled and patient.

Snowflake reached its free-cash-flow goal years ahead of time. Visa has more than 100 million merchants in its global network. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: KO Coca-Cola Market Cap $260B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.43%) -$0.26 Current Price $60.21 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These stocks have competitive advantages that can drive their long-term success. Warren Buffett is a name that's synonymous with investing success. Through his company, Berkshire Hathaway, he's managed to amass a fortune in the stock market rivaled by very few in history. Many Berkshire Hathaway shareholders have also gotten rich along the way. Buffett's investing philosophy has remained simple yet is tried and true: Invest in great businesses and hold them for the long haul. If you're looking for Buffett stocks to invest in right now, look no further than these three no-brainers. 1. Coca-Cola Coca-Cola (KO -0.43%) is up the fourth-largest position in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio, trailing behind only Apple, Bank of America, and Chevron. Buffett likes Coca-Cola because it's a stock he feels comfortable holding forever, primarily because of the company's iconic brand and unrivaled distribution. Impressively, Coca-Cola has managed to get distribution in more than 200 countries and territories around the world, which isn't easy to do -- especially profitably. In the first quarter of this year, the company increased its organic revenue (revenue from its core business operations) by 12% year over year. That's a decline from its Q4 2022 year-over-year growth, but it still beat earnings-per-share predictions by 5.4%. The company continues to add to its portfolio by investing in beverage categories outside of soft drinks. Coca-Cola's water and coffee segments unit case volume increased by 5% and 9%, respectively, outpacing its flagship Coca-Cola soda and other sparking soft drinks. There's no doubt soft drinks are Coca-Cola's main money-maker, but its long-term growth will likely depend on how well it can compete in high-growth categories such as ready-to-drink alcohol. The good news is Coca-Cola's management has shown its willingness to make the necessary investments to maintain its dominance and expand its offerings. You could argue that Coca-Cola is slightly overvalued, but if you're in it for the long term, you shouldn't be too concerned, given the company's track record. Add in the company's generous dividend, and you can be like Buffett and feel comfortable holding this stock forever. 2. Snowflake Snowflake (SNOW 0.73%) was a rare investment in an initial public offering (IPO) for Berkshire Hathaway, which purchased about $735 million worth of shares of the company at its $120 IPO price in September 2020. Snowflake's stock is now just over $155, which isn't a loss for Berkshire Hathaway, but it's also a far cry from its November 2021 high of about $392. Snowflake is a cloud data-warehousing platform that seems to have all the tools needed to be an industry leader for a long time. Buffett once said, ""If you aren't willing to own a stock for 10 years, don't even think about owning it for 10 minutes,"" and Snowflake should be a stock investors feel comfortable holding for a decade-plus. As of March 1, the company had just over 7,800 customers (up 31% year over year), with 330 spending at least $1 million annually with the company (up 79% year over year). And one way to know it's not just hype is Snowflake's 158% dollar-based net revenue retention rate. This means customers are spending 58% more each year with the company -- a key to longevity. Snowflake hasn't reached net profitability yet, but its free cash flow is impressive. In its 2022 investor day presentation, the company said it wanted to achieve 25% free-cash-flow margins (free cash flow as a percentage of revenue) by its 2029 fiscal year. It managed to hit 25% this past fiscal year, so the company is headed in the right direction. 3. Visa It's been a good few years for Visa (V 1.17%), which has outperformed the S&P 500 over the past five years. Visa has one of Buffett's favorite qualities in a company: a huge competitive moat. In Visa's case, its competitive moat is its merchant reach. As of the fiscal second-quarter ended March 31, Visa had more than 100 million merchants in its global network. Because Visa earns money by taking a percentage of the transactions it processes, it could take a slight hit if a recession occurs and causes people and businesses to slow spending. In the meantime, the company's been going strong. In fiscal Q2, Visa brought in $7.9 billion in revenue (up 11% year over year) and increased payments volume by 10%. Despite its impressive reach, there's still plenty of room for Visa to grow, considering how many countries still operate predominantly with cash. The gap it has on competitors will be all but impossible to close anytime soon -- especially if Visa continues growing at the current rate.

REUTERS/Rachel MummeyOMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N) posted a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit on Saturday, reflecting gains from stocks such as Apple Inc, while higher investment income and a rebound at car insurer Geico bolstered operating results.Berkshire also sped up repurchases of its own stock, buying back $4.4 billion, while paring its investments in other stocks such as Chevron Corp (CVX.N), which is still a major holding.Results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and manufacturing and retail units including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.MORE CASHNet income equaled $24,377 per Class A share and rose from $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share, a year earlier.That in part reflected a 27% jump in Apple's (AAPL.O) stock price, leaving Berkshire with a $151 billion stake in the iPhone maker.An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.Quarterly operating profit increased 13% to $8.07 billion, or about $5,561 per Class A share, from $7.16 billion.Those results benefited from Geico snapping a six-quarter string of underwriting losses, and a 68% increase in how much Berkshire's insurance units generate from investments.Geico's pretax underwriting gain was $703 million, benefiting from higher premiums, fewer crashes and a significant drop in ad spending, which may have led to fewer high-risk drivers seeking coverage.Berkshire's cash hoard grew $2 billion in the quarter to $130.6 billion, as the company sold $13.3 billion of stocks and bought just $2.9 billion.Chevron appears to have been among the sales, with Berkshire's stake falling 28% to $21.6 billion though the oil company's stock price dropped just 9%.Berkshire also owns a 23.6% stake in another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N).Its stock sales more than offset the $8.2 billion Berkshire spent to boost its stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers to 80% from 38.6%, leaving the founding Haslam family with 20%. The increase was expected.IMPACT OF WILDFIRESProfit at the BNSF railroad fell 9% to $1.25 billion, hurt by higher fuel costs and lower shipping volumes.Berkshire Hathaway Energy, normally a steady earnings generator, saw profit fall 46% as it set aside $359 million for legal and other costs from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has multiple operations, in 2020.Operating results also reflected October's purchase of insurance holding company Alleghany Corp, while net results included a gain related to Pilot.Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 4.9% this year, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500's (.SPX) 7.7% gain. The index lagged Berkshire by 23.4 percentage points in 2022, excluding dividends.Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Nextarticle with videoChargedcategoryToyota unveils sweeping plans for new battery tech, EV innovation12:12 PM UTCAutos & TransportationcategoryAnalysis: GM could reap billions by building combustion trucks and SUVs through 203512:26 PM UTCarticle with galleryWorld at WorkcategoryAnalysis: Tesla taps brakes on job ads after Musk clamps down on hiring10:10 AM UTCMedia & TelecomcategoryFox sends Tucker Carlson cease-and-desist letter - AxiosJune 12, 2023More from ReutersBusinessGermany plans purchase of six IRIS-T air defence units - sourceAerospace & Defensecategory · June 13, 2023 · 8:31 AM UTCGermany aims to purchase six IRIS-T air defence systems for its air force at a total cost of some 900 million euros ($971.73 million), a defence source told Reuters ahead of a final decision by lawmakers on Wednesday.Aerospace & DefensecategoryIsrael reports record $12.5 bln defence exports, 24% of them to Arab partners12:32 PM UTCChargedcategoryAnalysis: EV charger makers guardedly look to adopt Tesla standardJune 12, 2023FinancecategoryHSBC to close New Zealand wealth and personal banking business8:50 AM UTCAerospace & DefensecategoryUnited Air CEO sees pilot deal adding over $8 bln in costs - Bloomberg News11:27 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

""Envestnet Earnings Beat Estimates. The Stock is Falling"" by Andrew Welsch explores why technology and services provider Envestnet Inc ENV is still struggling to entice investors after reporting earnings that beat Wall Street estimates.

Editor May 6, 2023 1:59 PM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsApple reported strong second-quarter results on better-than-expected iPhone sales and robust Services revenue.Over next 5 years, investors will increasingly see Apple as a can’t live without consumer staples company, Munster says.Apple, Inc. AAPL reported better-than-expected second-quarter results on Thursday, helping to lift the market on Friday after four consecutive sessions of losses.What Happened: Following the news, Jim Cramer tweeted on Friday, ""Apple: Own it Don't Trade it.""  He also revealed that his patience with the company worked this past week, according to CNBC. The “Mad Money” host previously flagged four main challenges for the market this week, including Wednesday's Fed meeting, Friday's job report, the debt ceiling and Apple earnings.""I refuse to be shaken out of the world's best company by one errant component supplier or a couple of joker-brokers who say, ‘Hey, things have gotten weaker,'"" Cramer said in reference to the setback Apple experienced late last year when its main iPhone assembler Hon Hai Precision Manufacturing Company Limited HNHPF, otherwise known as Foxconn, faced production disruption at its main iPhone factory. ""It was a classic misdirection play, and I hope you didn't fall for it,"" Cramer added. See Also: Everything You Need To Know About Apple StockWhy It's Important: Twitter users had a field day with Cramer’s tweet on Friday. Given the television personality and former hedge fund manager’s history of making bets that eventually go awry, one user shared a meme of a person with a hopeless expression and a caption saying, ""Your entire life savings is in Apple and Jim just said to own it.""Notwithstanding the public criticism Cramer has received for his takes, Apple is considered a solid investment bet and fairly recession-resistant. In a note on Thursday, Deepwater Asset Management's Gene Munster wrote, ""Over the next five years, I expect investors will increasingly see Apple as a can't live without consumer staples company.""Read Next: Apple Earnings Call Takeaways: Emerging Market Strength, Guarded AI Approach, Muted Q3 Guidance And MorePhoto: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

REUTERS/Rachel MummeyOMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett on Saturday criticized the handling of recent tumult in the banking sector and said a debt ceiling showdown could bring ""turmoil"" to the financial system, even as he offered a vote of confidence in the United States and his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway Inc (BRKa.N).Speaking at Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting, Buffett criticized how politicians, regulators and the press have handled the recent failures of Silicon Valley Bank, Signature Bank and First Republic Bank, saying their ""very poor"" messaging has unnecessarily frightened depositors.""Fear is contagious,"" he said, adding that ""you can't run an economy"" when people worry if their money is safe in banks.Buffett also warned of a growing ""tribalism"" in Washington where partisanship causes people to talk past each other.""We have to refine, in a certain way, our democracy as we go along. But if I still had a choice, I would want to be born in the United States. It is a better world than we've ever had.""Buffett spoke hours after Berkshire posted a $35.5 billion quarterly profit and said it bought back $4.4 billion of its own stock, a sign it considered the shares undervalued.In contrast, it sold $13.3 billion of other companies' stocks, in a quarter where the S&P 500 Index (.SPX) rose 7%.The world's sixth-richest person, Buffett has since 1965 run Berkshire, whose dozens of businesses include Geico car insurance, the BNSF railroad and consumer names such as Dairy Queen and Fruit of the Loom.Berkshire also owns $328 billion of stocks, close to half in Apple Inc (AAPL.O).The meeting featured Buffett, 92, who is Berkshire's chairman and chief executive, and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger, 99, answering five hours of shareholder questions. Vice Chairmen Greg Abel, 60, and Ajit Jain, 71, joined in the morning.Buffett reiterated on Saturday that Abel would succeed him as CEO, while adding he had no plan if Abel could not.LIGHTED MATCHBuffett said regulators were right to guarantee depositors of Silicon Valley Bank, saying that not doing so ""would have been catastrophic.""He also said bank shareholders and executives should bear the risks of mismanagement, with Munger criticizing executives concerned more with getting rich than with customers.""A lighted match can be turned into a conflagration or can be blown out,"" Buffett said. ""You have to have punishment for people who do the wrong thing.""Buffett also said he could not imagine politicians or regulators being willing to ""disrupt the world's financial system,"" including if Washington failed to break its impasse on raising the debt ceiling, or how much the government could borrow.Anticipating questions on banking, Buffett prompted laughter by putting in front of him a sign reading ""AVAILABLE FOR SALE"" and one reading ""HELD-TO-MATURITY"" before Munger.These referred to how lenders account for their securities, a central issue in the recent banking crisis.Buffett said Berkshire is cautious about banks and sold some bank stocks in the past six months.Saturday's meeting is the centerpiece of a weekend Buffett calls ""Woodstock for Capitalists"" that draws tens of thousands of people to Omaha, Nebraska, its hometown.Attendance surged from 2022. Unlike last year the downtown arena hosting the meeting was filled to capacity.BUFFETT: ""APPLE IS A BETTER BUSINESS""In discussing Berkshire's performance, Buffett said perhaps a majority of its operating businesses may fare worse in 2023 than in 2022 as economic activity slows.But he said Berkshire can offset this with more income from investments, including $7 billion of Treasury bills bought in April.Buffett defended the size of Berkshire's $151 billion Apple investment, saying consumers are less likely to shed their $1,500 iPhones than, for example, their $35,000 second cars.""Apple is different than the other businesses we own,"" Buffett said. ""It just happens to be a better business.""Berkshire has recently held a 5.6% stake in Apple, and Buffett said it could buy more.""Portfolio management practices would suggested there is definitely concentration risk with having so much Apple in that portfolio,"" said Cathy Seifert, vice-president at CFRA Research.He also said that while Berkshire owns nearly one-fourth of Occidental Petroleum Corp (OXY.N), it has no plans to take control of the company.Munger, a longtime China bull who spearheaded Berkshire's investment in electric car company BYD Co , called for lowered tensions and increased trade between that country and the United States.Buffett cited those tensions in saying he is more comfortable deploying capital in Japan than in Taiwan.WAITING ON LINEPrior to the meeting, dozens of uniform-clad pilots at Berkshire-owned NetJets demonstrated outside the arena, protesting low pay and long hours.Thousands of shareholders, meanwhile, lined up outside the arena before it opened at 7 a.m. CDT (1200 GMT). Many recognized it could be one of their last chances to see Buffett and Munger, given their ages.Vidhya Vivekananda, an investment associate from Vancouver, Canada, said she and her husband showed up 30 minutes earlier for their first meeting.""It has been on our bucket list for a long time,"" she said. ""We don't know how long it will be with Warren and Charlie before they pass it on.""Yongsheng Zhao, who lives in Shanghai and is a researcher for an asset management firm, said he showed up at midnight with a chair to see Buffett and Munger for the eighth time.""I am inspired by their passion and normalcy,"" he said. ""I would hope they can go another five years, or more.""Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; additional reporting by Carolina Mandl and John McCrank in New York; Editing by Megan Davies, Ira Iosebashvili and Diane CraftOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Nextarticle with videoChargedcategoryToyota unveils sweeping plans for new battery tech, EV innovation12:12 PM UTCAutos & TransportationcategoryAnalysis: GM could reap billions by building combustion trucks and SUVs through 203512:26 PM UTCarticle with galleryWorld at WorkcategoryAnalysis: Tesla taps brakes on job ads after Musk clamps down on hiring10:10 AM UTCMedia & TelecomcategoryFox sends Tucker Carlson cease-and-desist letter - AxiosJune 12, 2023More from ReutersBusinessGermany plans purchase of six IRIS-T air defence units - sourceAerospace & Defensecategory · June 13, 2023 · 8:31 AM UTCGermany aims to purchase six IRIS-T air defence systems for its air force at a total cost of some 900 million euros ($971.73 million), a defence source told Reuters ahead of a final decision by lawmakers on Wednesday.Aerospace & DefensecategoryIsrael reports record $12.5 bln defence exports, 24% of them to Arab partners12:32 PM UTCChargedcategoryAnalysis: EV charger makers guardedly look to adopt Tesla standardJune 12, 2023FinancecategoryHSBC to close New Zealand wealth and personal banking business8:50 AM UTCAerospace & DefensecategoryUnited Air CEO sees pilot deal adding over $8 bln in costs - Bloomberg News11:27 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research 3 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy in May By John Ballard, Jeremy Bowman, and Jennifer Saibil – May 6, 2023 at 8:39AM Key Points Apple has an incredibly strong brand that made it one of the most profitable companies in the world. MercadoLibre is putting blockbuster growth in a wide-open market. Airbnb can generate years of growth through its adaptive platform. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These companies dominate the field in their respective industries. While no stock is immune from market swings, investors don't have to worry about short-term dips. Stocks ultimately follow the growth (or lack thereof) of the underlying business. What makes a company unstoppable is its ability to deliver sustainable growth in revenue and profits over the long term. That's what creates lasting wealth for shareholders. Apple (AAPL 1.56%), MercadoLibre (MELI 2.45%), and Airbnb (ABNB 5.71%) are all showing signs of real staying power, which could lead to many years of magnificent returns. Let's see why these Motley Fool contributors believe these companies are unstoppable. Invest in the products people can't live without John Ballard (Apple): When trying to identify a company that could be unstoppable, you want to think of powerful brands that millions of people rely on every day. On that criteria alone, it's hard to not to like Apple, whose flagship product, the iPhone, is an indispensable device for many. While sales could soften during a severe economic downturn, investors shouldn't be concerned about that, because Apple has a very loyal customer base. This is noted by its consistently high customer satisfaction scores and its growing installed base of active devices, now over 2 billion. Plus, the company introduced several new services in recent years that are driving consistent year-round revenue, like Apple TV+, Apple Card, Apple Pay, and more. Apple will continue to drive repeat upgrades as it invests in artificial intelligence to make its products even better. This will create a stickier attachment between customers and their devices. Investors can't go wrong investing in strong brands that generate massive cash flows. Over the last four quarters, Apple generated a whopping $97 billion in free cash flow on $387 billion of revenue. It's got more cash than it knows what to do with, which is why management continues to plow funds into share repurchases and quarterly dividend payments. It's for these reasons Apple is an unstoppable stock to consider buying this month. An e-commerce superstar Jeremy Bowman (MercadoLibre): If you're looking for unstoppable stocks to buy this month, look no further than MercadoLibre, the Latin American e-commerce company that has been a top performer on the stock market over its history. MercadoLibre just offered a reminder of why the stock is still a top buy in its first-quarter earnings report. Currency-neutral revenue in the quarter jumped 58% to $3 billion with total payment volume nearly doubling, up 96% to $37 billion. Gross merchandise volume, meanwhile, also surged 43% to $9.4 billion. MercadoLibre's strength across e-commerce and digital payments makes it unique, and the company has also built formidable businesses in logistics with Mercado Envios and lending with Mercado Credito. Unlike its U.S-based e-commerce counterparts, MercadoLibre has continued to put up strong growth over the last year even as the pandemic tailwinds slowed, a sign the company continues to gain market share and is penetrating a large market that is still behind the U.S. in e-commerce adoption. MercadoLibre's profitability also ramped up as it gained scale in e-commerce and payments. Operating margin in the first quarter jumped from 6.2% in the quarter a year ago to 11.2%, giving it an operating income of $340 million. As the company builds scale with its first-party e-commerce business and digital payments investments, it's been able to layer on higher-margin businesses like its third-party marketplace, its credits business, and advertising, following in the footsteps of Amazon. The company doesn't provide guidance, but its growth momentum looks as strong as ever, and the company should continue to gain market share as it penetrates the massive Latin American market. It's about time for travel to be disrupted Jennifer Saibil (Airbnb): It's not surprising that the travel industry has been upended. For decades it was dominated by large hotel chains, whether of the luxury or budget variety, with a sprinkling of vacation rentals abounding once the internet made them more accessible. Airbnb took that concept to new heights, and its platform, which matches renters and hosts, ballooned into the premier travel site of its kind. Growth is robust but is easing a bit. Triple-digit sales growth that marked a rebound from the pandemic has decelerated to double digits. Revenue rose 24% year over year in the 2022 fourth quarter to $1.9 billion. But the growth runway is very long. Airbnb offers an agile system that can adapt to changing consumer needs and trends, as opposed to legacy hotel companies that take tons of time and money to get new buildings up. Travelers are using the platform to vacation in a different way, such as living in new areas. That's both as a vacation, where renters are exploring out-of-the-way areas that the big chains aren't accessing, and full-time living. Rentals of 28 days or more continue to be an important segment, remaining at 21% of bookings in the fourth quarter. Airbnb has also become sustainably profitable. It posted net income for the past three consecutive quarters as well as an annual profit in 2022. It's also awash in cash, ending the year with $3.4 billion in free cash flow. Airbnb made a bold move when it went public at the end of 2020 amid heavy sales declines. But investors scooped it up regardless, partially due to its incredible market opportunity, and partially due to the general initial public offering craze and robust bull market that was taking place at that time. The price skyrocketed, and it's now down 44% since its highs in 2021. At this price, shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 43. That's not incredibly cheap, but it's down to a more reasonable level. With Airbnb's opportunities, investors could consider that valuation low enough to purchase shares.

REUTERS/Scott MorganOMAHA, Nebraska, May 6 (Reuters) - Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRKa.N posted a $35.5 billion first-quarter profit on Saturday, reflecting gains from stocks such as Apple Inc, while higher investment income and a rebound at car insurer Geico bolstered operating results.Berkshire also sped up repurchases of its own stock, buying back $4.4 billion, while paring its investments in other stocks such as Chevron Corp CVX.N, which is still a major holding.Results were released ahead of Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in Omaha, part of a weekend that draws tens of thousands of people to the city.Buffett, 92, has run Berkshire since 1965, transforming it from a struggling textile company into a conglomerate with dozens of businesses including Geico, the BNSF railroad, Berkshire Hathaway Energy, and manufacturing and retail units including See's Candies and Dairy Queen ice cream.The diversification has led many investors, not just Buffett fans, to view Berkshire as a stable long-term investment even amid recession fears and concerns about the banking industry.MORE CASHNet income equaled $24,377 per Class A share and rose from $5.58 billion, or $3,784 per share, a year earlier.That in part reflected a 27% jump in Apple's AAPL.O stock price, leaving Berkshire with a $151 billion stake in the iPhone maker.An accounting rule requires Berkshire to report unrealized gains and losses with net results, and Buffett urges investors to ignore the resulting volatility.Quarterly operating profit increased 13% to $8.07 billion, or about $5,561 per Class A share, from $7.16 billion.Those results benefited from Geico snapping a six-quarter string of underwriting losses, and a 68% increase in how much Berkshire's insurance units generate from investments.Geico's pretax underwriting gain was $703 million, benefiting from higher premiums, fewer crashes and a significant drop in ad spending, which may have led to fewer high-risk drivers seeking coverage.Berkshire's cash hoard grew $2 billion in the quarter to $130.6 billion, as the company sold $13.3 billion of stocks and bought just $2.9 billion.Chevron appears to have been among the sales, with Berkshire's stake falling 28% to $21.6 billion though the oil company's stock price dropped just 9%.Berkshire also owns a 23.6% stake in another oil company, Occidental Petroleum Corp OXY.N.Its stock sales more than offset the $8.2 billion Berkshire spent to boost its stake in truck stop operator Pilot Travel Centers to 80% from 38.6%, leaving the founding Haslam family with 20%. The increase was expected.IMPACT OF WILDFIRESProfit at the BNSF railroad fell 9% to $1.25 billion, hurt by higher fuel costs and lower shipping volumes.Berkshire Hathaway Energy, normally a steady earnings generator, saw profit fall 46% as it set aside $359 million for legal and other costs from wildfires in Oregon and northern California, where it has multiple operations, in 2020.Operating results also reflected October's purchase of insurance holding company Alleghany Corp, while net results included a gain related to Pilot.Berkshire's Class A shares have risen 4.9% this year, trailing the Standard & Poor's 500's .SPX 7.7% gain. The index lagged Berkshire by 23.4 percentage points in 2022, excluding dividends.(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander Smith and Diane Craft)Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in Omaha, Nebraska; Editing by Alexander SmithOur Standards: The Thomson Reuters Trust Principles.Read Nextarticle with videoChargedcategoryToyota unveils sweeping plans for new battery tech, EV innovation12:12 PM UTCAutos & TransportationcategoryAnalysis: GM could reap billions by building combustion trucks and SUVs through 203512:26 PM UTCarticle with galleryWorld at WorkcategoryAnalysis: Tesla taps brakes on job ads after Musk clamps down on hiring10:10 AM UTCMedia & TelecomcategoryFox sends Tucker Carlson cease-and-desist letter - AxiosJune 12, 2023More from ReutersBusinessGermany plans purchase of six IRIS-T air defence units - sourceAerospace & Defensecategory · June 13, 2023 · 8:31 AM UTCGermany aims to purchase six IRIS-T air defence systems for its air force at a total cost of some 900 million euros ($971.73 million), a defence source told Reuters ahead of a final decision by lawmakers on Wednesday.Aerospace & DefensecategoryIsrael reports record $12.5 bln defence exports, 24% of them to Arab partners12:32 PM UTCChargedcategoryAnalysis: EV charger makers guardedly look to adopt Tesla standardJune 12, 2023FinancecategoryHSBC to close New Zealand wealth and personal banking business8:50 AM UTCAerospace & DefensecategoryUnited Air CEO sees pilot deal adding over $8 bln in costs - Bloomberg News11:27 AM UTCSite IndexBrowseWorldBusinessLegalMarketsBreakingviewsTechnologyInvestigations, opens new tabLifestyleAbout ReutersAbout Reuters, opens new tabCareers, opens new tabReuters News Agency, opens new tabBrand Attribution Guidelines, opens new tabReuters Leadership, opens new tabReuters Fact Check, opens new tabReuters Diversity Report, opens new tabStay InformedDownload the App, opens new tabNewsletters, opens new tabInformation you can trustReuters, the news and media division of Thomson Reuters, is the world’s largest multimedia news provider, reaching billions of people worldwide every day.

View All Top Stories Profit From the Best AND Worst Stocks! SPY – Stock markets suffered through a rough year in 2022. Major indices like the S&P 500 (SPY) and NASDAQ 100 were down double digits across the board. Yet this simple strategy showed a solid double-digit gain by taking profitable positions in both good AND bad stocks. This type of balanced approach will likely continue to outperform in what looks like to be a tough second half of 2023. Read on below to find out more… By Tim Biggam May 6, 2023 2022 was one of the worst years for stocks in a long time. After a strong start to 2023, stocks are failing to break out at recent highs. What happens the rest of the year remains to be seen. The recent rise in interest rates along with a continued earnings recession is likely to be an overhang that will continue to stall stocks for the final two quarters of 2023. The average annual return for stocks (S&P 500) over the past 150 years is roughly 9%, including dividends. Without dividends it drops to just over 4.5%. Inflation shaves about half off those returns. A return back towards more historic returns may look pretty good in the coming 12 months. Stock selection will be critical to performing well in 2023, rather than just buying any stock -which was seemingly the way to easy gains up until 2022. The POWR Ratings can certainly provide investors and traders with a clear edge when selecting stocks. Over the past 20 plus years, the A Rated strong buys in the POWR Ratings have outperformed the S&P 500 by over 22% annually. While this level of outperformance is truly eye-opening, selling the F rated strong sell stocks would have beaten the overall market by an even greater degree. These lowest rated stocks actually fell over 21% per year while the S&P 500 gained nearly 7% annually. This equates to an underperformance of roughly 28%! This means the bad stocks fell a bit worse than the good stocks rose in comparison to the S&P 500. Many investors and traders are not comfortable shorting stocks. Unlimited potential loss increases the fear factor even more. Luckily, the options market provides a defined risk solution to profit from a pullback in stocks. Puts. Owning a put option gives you the ability to sell a stock at a specific price before a certain time. The put buyer pays money upfront – called the option premium. For instance, buying the Apple July $155 put at $4.30 gives the buyer the right to sell AAPL stock at $155 until expiration on 7/21/2023 (the third Friday in July). The price of these bearish put options will increase as the stock goes down and decrease if the stock rises. The most at risk is $430 ($4.30 premium x 100) Buying put options is a simple, but very effective way, to take a bearish stance on bad stocks (using Apple as an example, not that is a bad stock). To help offset this bearish view, POWR Options combines it with a bullish trade that is done with a call purchase. Owning a call option gives you the ability to buy a stock at a specific price before a certain time. The call buyer again pays money upfront – called the option premium. For instance, buying the Apple July $175 call at $4.50 gives the buyer the right to buy AAPL stock at $175 until expiration on 7/21/2023 (the third Friday in July). The price of these bullish call options will increase as the stock goes up and decrease if the stock drops. The most at risk is $450 ($4.50 premium x 100). But instead of just combining puts and calls on the same stock, POWR options uses the power of the POWR Ratings to combine puts on the lowest rated (D and F) names along with bullish calls on the highest rated (A and B) stocks. Sell the worst and buy the best-but define the risk. Pairing a bearish put and bullish call together is called a “Pairs Trade”. These two trades together combine for a much more neutral outlook. It is a strategy we successfully use day in and day out in the POWR Options Portfolio to take a more balanced “Pairs Trade” approach by combining bearish puts with bullish calls. It worked very well in 2022 and continues to work very well so far in 2023. A recent example of this POWR Pairs approach using the power of the POWR ratings for bearish put plays and bullish call plays may help shed some light on things. Below is a recent POWR Pairs trade done in the POWR Options Portfolio on Acuity Brands (AYI) and Roblox (RBLX). AYI was an A rated- Strong Buy -stock in a C rated Industry. Number one in the industry. Strong stock in a strong position. RBLX was an F rated -Strong Sell – stock in a D rated industry. Ranked at the bottom in the industry group as well, so pretty much the worst of the worst. Yet over the past few weeks, much lower rated Roblox had been outperforming much higher rated Acuity by a wide margin. In fact, since the beginning of the year A rated AYI was lower by almost 5% while F rated RBLX screamed much higher-up 60%!. This set up ideally for a POWR Pairs trade. Buying bullish calls on the big-time underperforming Strong Buy AYI and bearish puts on the hugely outperforming Strong Sell RBLX. The expectation was for the spread between the two to converge back towards a more normal comparative performance with AYI outperforming RBLX. That proved to be the case. RBLX dropped sharply while AYI traded sideways. The spread converged from over 60% at trade inception (red) to 25% at close out (green). POWR Options closed out the POWR Pairs trade for a $210 overall gain. $40 loss on the AYI calls and a $250 gain on the RBLX puts.  Trade took 16 days from start to finish. Over a 20% gain on the $970 invested in both the AYI calls ($500) and RBLX puts ($470). Not bad for a few weeks work on a neutral trade. This table below shows the most recent six closeouts for POWR Options. All 6 were overall winning trades with a holding period averaging just a few weeks. All very similar to the AYI/RBLX POWR Pairs trade. The ability to say nimble and be more neutral has served the POWR Options Portfolio so far. Our trading showed solid gains since inception versus losses for stocks in that same time frame. Using the POWR ratings to help us select the best of the best stocks to be bullish on with call buys, along with the worst of the worst stocks to be bearish on with put purchases, will likely continue to prove profitable in 2023.

Home Investing Stocks Stock Market Today: Apple Earnings, Bank Stocks Spark Relief Rally The April jobs report creates uncertainty around the Fed's future policy plans, but it didn't stop the major indexes from soaring Friday. Newsletter sign up Newsletter (Image credit: Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) By Karee Venema published 5 May 2023 Stocks rallied hard Friday despite a stronger-than-expected jobs report. A significant driver behind today's broad market gains was an impressive earnings report from mega-cap tech giant Apple (AAPL), while a rebound in regional bank stocks also lifted sentiment. Kiplinger's Weekly Earnings CalendarAhead of the opening bell, the Bureau of Labor Statistics said the U.S. added 253,000 jobs in April, blowing past estimates for an increase of 185,000. The unemployment rate ticked down to 3.4% from 3.5%, while wage growth was up 0.5% month-over-month and 4.4% year-over-year.

Profit and prosper with the best of expert advice - straight to your e-mail. Sign up Many of Wall Street's top minds were quick to chime in on the April jobs report, including Matt Peron, director of research at Janus Henderson Investors. ""The jobs report was uncomfortably strong for policymakers who are trying to tame inflation,"" Peron says. ""The best you can say from today's report is that job growth is slowing when looking at the average over the past few months. However, wages were stubbornly high and that's a key aspect of the report for the Fed and markets.""So, while today's data does help ease recession worries, it creates uncertainty as to how long the Fed will keep interest rates elevated in its efforts to rein in inflation. Nevertheless, the Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped 1.7% to 33,674, the S&P 500 soared 1.9% to 4,136, and the Nasdaq Composite added 2.3% to 12,235. The reason: Apple stock.Apple earningsShares of the blue chip stock jumped 4.7% on Friday after the company reported better-than-expected fiscal Q2 earnings and revenue thanks to record quarterly sales for both its iPhone and services segments. Apple also hiked its dividend by 4% and said it is boosting stock buybacks by an additional $90 billion.Apple wasn't the only stock making an outsized move today. After being walloped all week long, several regional bank stocks staged massive relief rallies. PacWest Bancorp (PACW) soared 81.7%, Western Alliance (WAL) surged 49.2% and Zions Bancorp (ZION) climbed 19.2%.Today's jobs data and AI stocksThere were some key figures in today's jobs report that caught the eye of Andrew Crapuchettes, CEO of RedBalloon. ""The number of people employed over the past year is up 3 million, or 1.9%, and wages are up 4.4%,"" Crapuchettes wrote in a blog post. ""Total unemployed since last year is down 311,000, or 5.2%."" And this, the executive adds, is ""likely why we see such a sudden rise in AI. There aren't enough people to get the job done, and AI is one avenue businesses are exploring to fill in the gaps.""Plenty of firms are already employing artificial intelligence. A study by IBM found that in 2022, 35% of companies were using AI in their businesses, with another 42% reportedly exploring AI. These figures will likely continue to increase as AI gains in popularity, and will boost the artificial intelligence market in the process. Indeed, the global AI market is projected to grow at an annual rate of 37.3% through 2023, according to Grand View Research.Investors wanting to capitalize on this rapid growth have plenty of opportunities at their disposal. But when looking for the best stocks to buy, it's important to focus on high-quality names like those included in Kiplinger's list of the best AI stocks. The 9 Best Vanguard Mutual Funds to Buy Explore More Stock Watch Markets Stock Market Today Apple (AAPL) Karee VenemaSocial Links NavigationContributing Editor, Kiplinger.comWith over a decade of experience writing about the stock market, Karee Venema is an investing editor and options expert at Kiplinger.com.

Coffey May 5, 2023 2:06 PM |  9 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Friday market open) Despite recession talk, the U.S. labor market continues to flex its muscle, with 253,000 jobs added in April. However, downward revisions to the last two jobs reports mean the labor market might not be quite as well-toned as today’s number suggests.Today’s April Nonfarm Payrolls report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics showed job growth well above analysts’ expectations for around 180,000 and up sharply from a downwardly revised 165,000 in March. In fact, the government now says February and March jobs growth was a combined 149,000 less than it previously reported, which could ease worries that today’s higher number might lead the Federal Reserve to consider more interest rate hikes.Major indexes enter Friday in a four-day tailspin following this week’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) rate hike, banking system worries, and rising volatility. The Dow Jones Industrial Average® ($DJI) turned negative for 2023 yesterday, though the S&P 500® index (SPX) and the Nasdaq 100® (NDX) remain in positive territory for now. Regional bank shares rebounded a bit this morning after getting crushed yesterday.Stock futures generally kept their earlier premarket gains after the jobs report, perhaps a sign that investors are becoming more worried about a possible recession than they are about the Fed. This report, which beat analysts’ expectations as every jobs report has over the last year, suggests continued resilience in the economy, though services-related businesses, not goods-producing ones, dominated jobs growth.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) jumped 5 basis points to 3.4% ahead of the jobs report. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) inched up to 101.36. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures eased to 18.94 from yesterday’s nearly one-month high. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) climbed to $70.48 per barrel. Treasury yields and crude both clawed back from recent losses early Friday—often a sign of improved investor sentiment about the economy. These remain helpful barometers.Just InToday’s robust jobs report comes two days after the latest Fed rate hike, which increased interest rates to more than 5%—their highest level in 16 years. The Fed’s been trying to slow economic growth, but the jobs market continues to gallop ahead. This raises the question of whether “good news is bad news.” Will this data cause the Fed to hike again next month?For now, the market is reacting positively to the solid economic news. Beyond the headline number and revisions to the prior two reports, things pretty much stayed in place. Labor market participation remained at 62.6%—about where it was before the pandemic. Unemployment of 3.4% was little changed from 3.5% in March and remains at historic lows.Also, a sharp downward revision to March jobs growth is catching some eyes this morning. It now stands at 165,000, down from the original 236,000.One worry on the inflation front is a 0.5% rise in hourly wages, which is above the 0.3% analysts had expected. Sectors that added the most jobs in April include business and professional services, health care, leisure and hospitality, and government. Manufacturing and construction employment were little changed.Stocks in the SpotlightApple AAPL beat analysts’ estimates for earnings per share (EPS) and revenue in its quarterly report released late yesterday, and the stock initially popped about 2%. The positive market response might have had more to do with AAPL’s announcement of a dividend increase and a $90 billion stock buyback than with quarterly results, which, with some exceptions, weren’t incredibly powerful and surpassed a relatively low bar from Wall Street. A miss of analysts’ expectations for the Services unit disappointed, but iPhone sales were a hit and helped buoy the quarter. Overall, it was the second straight quarter of declining year-over-year revenue for the tech giant. iPhone sales beat analysts’ expectations by more than $2 billion, though analysts say some of that may reflect pull-through from a weak holiday quarter as China reopened. In other words, the growth could be due to one-time circumstances. Services sales rose, but growth was below 6% in that key category for AAPL’s margin, and revenue came in under analysts’ expectations. Growth in Services, which includes the App store, Apple Music, and Apple Pay, has slowed significantly over the last year. Mac sales fell and looked weak, as many on Wall Street had expected, and iPad sales also declined. Sales in the closely watched China market continued to drop, offering another sign that perhaps the economy there isn’t recovering as quickly as expected. Qualcomm (QCOM) said earlier this week that it hadn’t seen evidence of a China recovery in the smartphone business, which is one reason AAPL’s better iPhone sales came as a bit of a surprise.Earnings Lull: The next phase of earnings season is a few weeks off when major retailers get their turns in the spotlight. Next week is a definite reprieve after two weeks of frenzied earnings releases, as most of the best-known companies in banking, tech, industrials and other closely watched sectors are done reporting. In normal times, this might represent a welcome easing in volatility, but with banking concerns front and center, that seems unlikely this time around.There are some high-profile companies reporting next week, including PayPal (PYPL), Duke Energy, (DUK), and UnderArmour (UAA). But none are more notable than Disney (DIS), which is expected to open its books on Wednesday after the close.Eye on the FedThe market sees a high likelihood that rates will be lower by the end of the year. The question is how do we get from where we are now to there? It would likely take a major disruption in banking or a severe downturn in economic prospects, or both, yet it’s still priced in. This could help explain why bearish market sentiment remains extremely elevated. The probability of a rate pause in June is 90%, according to the CME’s FedWatch Tool. That’s down from 98% before the jobs report, and there’s now a 9% chance of a rate hike next month, up from 0% before the jobs report.The Fed’s quiet period around the FOMC meeting is over, so get ready for Fed speakers to make the rounds once more. Regional banking stocks plunged again yesterday after Canada’s Toronto-Dominion Bank Group called off its $13.4 billion takeover of First Horizon Corp (FHN). There’s talk on Wall Street about how to stop the sell-off in regional banks, including higher government deposit insurance guarantees or even a moratorium on the short selling of banking stocks, though this appears to be just talk for now.What to WatchInflation alert: Investors likely want to steel themselves for April Consumer Price Index (CPI) and Producer Price Index (PPI) data next week. They’re due out Wednesday and Thursday, respectively. Expectations on Wall Street are for CPI to rise 0.4% month-over-month and core CPI (which strips out energy and food) to climb 0.3%, according to Trading Economics. That’s compared with 0.1% and 0.4% in March. The core CPI is the one to watch most closely, keeping in mind that pricier gasoline in April likely influenced the headline number.Talking technicals: The SPX is closing in on what may be a key technical support point at 4,039, the 50-day moving average. The index came within a whisker of that intraday Thursday before rebounding slightly. Selling pressure could potentially pick up if that level gets breached. CHART OF THE DAY: A long-term chart of the KBW Nasdaq Bank Index (BKX—candlesticks), suggests that bank stocks may have another big drop in them. A 10-year graph reinforces that idea. If it hit the support level on the chart, the index would be down about 60% from its January 2022 high. Data source: Nasdaq. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investOracle time: Not the company, the one in in Omaha. This weekend’s Nebraska retreat features the latest views from Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett and Vice Chairman Charlie Munger. With all the bank jitters lately, investors might want to hear their thoughts on the regional banking industry. The two nonagenarians will also likely face questions about the Fed’s policy and the economy in general, as well as their company’s portfolio. A major holding of theirs, Apple (AAPL) could be in the spotlight after its earnings report yesterday, as well as oil companies, which Buffett recently built a heavy stake in only to see crude fall to late-2021 lows this week. It’s already been a wild two weeks for the market, but Buffett and Munger’s gathering may be one reason to put off your golf game this weekend.Shining on: While Fed Chairman Jerome Powell strongly hinted this week that he has no plans to cut rates absent an economic crisis, the gold market tells a different story. Gold futures (/GC) rose more than 1% Thursday and came within shouting distance of the metal’s all-time high of $2,089 an ounce, set back in August 2020. Gold isn’t just benefitting from hopes of lower U.S. rates; it’s also getting a lift from the U.S. dollar index, which continues to trade near 2023 lows. It’s still holding on to the 101 handle, but that’s down from nearly 115 last fall. Watch the dollar following today’s jobs report and next week’s U.S. inflation data to see if it gets a lift or not from economic activity.Earnings season update: Today brings the latest update on Q1 earnings from research firm FactSet, which comes amid generally better-than-expected Q1 results. The last FactSet estimate was for a 3.7% drop in year-over-year S&P 500 earnings, but some analysts now expect less than a 3% decline. What’s problematic is estimates coming down for later this year. Widespread hopes for earnings to rebound in the second half of the year have been fading, with some on Wall Street now penciling in overall S&P 500 earnings to drop slightly in 2023. With the S&P 500 index (SPX) still trading at a historically elevated forward multiple above 18, it may be hard for investors to get enthusiastic if it looks like earnings can’t at least slightly recover by year’s end.CalendarMay 8: March Wholesale Inventories and expected earnings from Tyson Foods (TSN) and PayPal (PYPL).May 9: Expected earnings from UnderArmour (UAA).May 10: April Consumer Price Index (CPI) and core CPI, and expected earnings from Disney (DIS).May 11: April Producer Price Index (PPI) and core PPI and expected earnings from JD.com (JD).May 12: Preliminary May University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

Home Investing Stocks Stocks-to-buy Apple Stock Remains a Strong Buy Even as Shares Soar Apple stock has added more than $680 billion in value this year and it still has more room to run, analysts say. Newsletter sign up Newsletter (Image credit: Getty Images) By Dan Burrows published 5 May 2023 Apple (AAPL) stock popped after better-than-expected iPhone sales helped it beat Wall Street's quarterly profit and sales estimates – and analysts say shares in the mega-cap tech giant are just getting started.Apple stock jumped more than 5% at one point in early Friday trading thanks to upbeat fiscal second-quarter results released the previous evening. As a company with a market capitalization of more than $2.6 trillion at the beginning of the session, a 5% increase in Apple's stock price adds more than $130 billion in value to one of analysts' top Dow stocks. If You'd Put $1,000 Into Apple Stock 20 Years Ago, Here's What You'd Have TodayFor the three months ended April 1, Cupertino, California-based Apple reported earnings of $1.52 a share, easily topping analysts' forecast for earnings per share (EPS) of $1.43, according to S&P Global Markets Intelligence. Revenue declined 3% to $94.8 billion, vs the Street's estimate for revenue of $92.8 billion. Subscribe to Kiplinger’s Personal Finance Be a smarter, better informed investor.

Sign up ""We are pleased to report an all-time record in Services and a March quarter record for iPhone despite the challenging macroeconomic environment, and to have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high,"" Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a press release. The global smartphone market suffered a 15% decline in shipments during the first three months of 2023, according to market researcher IDC, and Apple was expected to go along for the ride. But unexpected strength in iPhone sales – quarterly segment revenue increased 2% year-over-year – helped Apple exceed the Street's expectations. Also boosting Apple stock were additional efforts to return more cash to shareholders. Apple upped its dividend by 4% to 24 cents per share quarterly. Furthermore, Apple's board of directors authorized an additional program to buy back up to $90 billion of AAPL stock. Apple stock: Buy, Hold or Sell?(Image credit: Getty Images)Apple stock has rallied an almost incomprehensible 33% for the year-to-date, adding roughly $680 billion in market value. To put that in perspective, including Apple, only five companies in the S&P 500 have market caps of more than $680 billion. And yet the Street says shares have plenty of upside left. Of the 45 analysts issuing opinions on Apple stock surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence, 25 rate it at Strong Buy, nine say Buy, nine call it a Hold, one says Sell and one rates it at Strong Sell. That works out to a consensus recommendation of Buy, with high conviction.We'll let Oppenheimer analyst Martin Yang sum up the bullish investment thesis for Apple stock: ""We expect Apple's defensive moats to strengthen under the challenging macro backdrop, resulting in long-term, sustainable share gains in hardware and services.""Best Blue Chip Dividend Stocks to Buy NowYang rates AAPL at Outperform (the equivalent of Buy), and raised his price target to $195 from $170. The new price target gives Apple stock implied price upside of 13% in the next 12 months or so.For context, the Street's highest price target of $210 gives Apple stock implied upside of 20%. At the other end of the range, Apple stock would have to fall 33% from current levels to hit the Street's lowest price target, which stands at $116. True, Apple beat a pretty low bar for estimates. But it did so resoundingly, and very much relied on the ""sticky"" ecosystem of products and services that no less an investing luminary than Warren Buffett praises.Don't forget: the chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) calls Apple his ""third business."" That's why Apple is the Oracle of Omaha's top stock pick, accounting for nearly 40% of the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio. As one of the best stocks of the past 30 years – and a name that has generated stupendous wealth for anyone who bought Apple stock 20 years ago – it certainly is hard to bet against Apple. All 30 Dow Stocks Ranked: The Pros Weigh In Explore More Apple (AAPL) Dan BurrowsSocial Links NavigationSenior Investing Writer, Kiplinger.comDan Burrows is Kiplinger's senior investing writer, having joined the august publication full time in 2016.

Δ We're never going down ever again. You read that correctly, right? I read your emails and your chat comments. And a lot of you have called me irresponsible for saying that. To those calling me that, I have a question for you... Have you seen what's happening in the markets? When I say ""We're never going down ever again"", you need to understand what that means. Think about this statement in terms of what we do as traders. We aren't putting on call spreads or trying to predict where a stock will be next week, next month, or by the end of the year. Sign up for SMS so you never miss special events, exclusive offers, and weekly bonus trades. Your goal as a trader is to make yourself profits every day the market is open by making your plan, executing your trade, and getting out with a profit or a small loss. That's all we do. And if you're scared that a stock is going to go down, or you are shorting because you heard doom and gloom on the news... You need to change your mentality ASAP. Somehow, despite the fact that apparently the financial system is collapsing, the U.S. is about to default on its debt, inflation is out of control and WWIII is about to happen... The market is up to today and the QQQ is up 1.5%. Apple is up almost 5%. Draft Kings (DKNG) is up 15%. AMD is up 2%. The S&P 500 is up 60 points from yesterday. Who in their right mind is shorting this market? Because whoever it is, is getting crushed right now. I am never missing out on another long trade again. Remember what happened to me yesterday? I was calling out to buy Paramount (PARA) on the dip and missed my own trade. Members of Warlock's World got it, but I let my doubts and my emotions get the better of me. No more emotions. No more doubts. We find our patterns, we make our buys, we get in and we get out. AAPL today was a buy. DKNG was a buy. The Q's today were a buy. The more I hear some hack on CNBC tell the world that we're in a bear market, the more I love laughing in their face and making a bullish trade for the day. And if you want to laugh in their face with me...Then join me in the Warlock's World today! The post Buy the dip because we're never going down again appeared first on This Is VWAP.

Benzinga Contributor May 5, 2023 1:16 PM |  6 min read Short selling ban on bank stocks is likely about to happen. The White House is monitoring the short-selling pressure very closely. They need to avoid chaos and collapse at all costs. This is what they did in 2008.MarketPrices as of 4 pm EST, 5/4/23MacroThe US trade gap narrowed to a 4-month low in March. Exports increased by 2.1% to $256.2 billion while imports slowed by 0.3% to $320.4 billion as consumers spend less on goods and the labor market (slowly) cools. America’s trade deficit with China fell to its lowest since March 2020. The FDIC plans to refill its Deposit Insurance Fund (DIF) with help from fees imposed on big banks. The amount banks pay will be based on the size of their balance sheets and the number of depositors. Smaller banks with less than $10 billion in assets will be exempt from the special assessment fee. The proposal could be introduced as early as next week. Initial jobless claims in the US increased by the most in 6 weeks, rising more than expected to 242,000. The climb suggests some cooling in a resilient labor market. Continuing claims, on the other hand, dropped by 38,000, the largest decline since July. StocksPacific West Bancorp wants the world to know it is NOT PacWest Bancorp. The former made changes to the front page of its website to explicitly state it has no association whatsoever with the latter. Pacific West (not PacWest) shares trade over the counter at a $28 million market cap and have declined just 3.6% YTD. Meanwhile, the actual PacWest saw its value cut in half yesterday. Its decline led an index of regional banks down to levels not seen since September 2020. Also falling sharply was First Horizon, which watched shares drop 33% after its merger with TD Bank was terminated. Other big losers included Western Alliance (-38%) and Zion Bank (-12%). Investors will be turning to long-duration assets to hedge against a possible recession this year, according to JPMorgan strategists. That means increased demand for gold, tech stocks, and non-USD currencies. Gold is currently flirting with all-time highs while the share of tech in global equities has risen sharply, suggesting investors are increasingly overweight tech. EnergyUS oil prices are on pace for their third consecutive weekly drop after falling more than 8% this week. Prices briefly collapsed to their lowest intraday level since 2021 yesterday before rebounding. Despite the drop, the physical market remains tight which suggests the decline may be excessive. EarningsYesterday’s highlights: Apple AAPL: $1.52 EPS (vs. $1.43 expected), $94.84 billion in sales (vs. $92.96B expected). Apple topped expectations for iPhone sales but missed those for Mac and iPad. iPhone revenue increased 2% YoY while the broader smartphone industry contracted ~15% over the same period. Mac and iPad revenues, meanwhile, dropped 21% and 13% YoY, respectively. Overall revenue fell 3% YoY while net income declined by the same amount.

The BofA Analyst: Wamsi Mohan reiterated his Neutral rating on Apple and set a price target of $176.Mohan praised the company's execution and iPhone sales growth, though he expressed concerns about the lack of a major catalyst to drive higher demand, a potential iPhone mix reversion and weaker Services growth in the near term.The Oppenheimer Analyst: Martin Yang provided an overview of Apple's supply chain derivatives, noting that the company's iPhone sales growth was a positive sign for suppliers including Qualcomm Inc QCOM, Qorvo Inc QRVO, Broadcom Inc AVGO, and Cirrus Logic, Inc.

He noted Apple's revenue guidance was below consensus but in line with buy-side expectations and that the company's cost controls provided reasons to be optimistic.The Needham Capital Markets Analyst: Needham raised its price target on Apple to $195 and maintained its Buy rating.The firm highlighted Apple's installed base of more than 2 billion active devices, which drove nearly 2% year-over-year revenue growth and $28.6 billion of operating cash flow in the second quarter.Needham saw Apple as a safe investment option for investors amid an uncertain macro and consumer demand landscape.Apple's second-quarter revenues were $94.8 billion, down 3% year-over-year but 3% above the firm's estimate. The company's services revenue reached an all-time high at $20.9 billion, up 5% year-over-year, while products revenue was $73.9 billion, down 5% year-over-year due to lower Mac and iPad revenue.The Bernstein Analyst: Toni Sacconaghi said Apple's second-quarter earnings were largely as expected. He noted the company's revenue growth was strong in emerging markets but relatively weak in the U.S. and the Americas.Apple's third-quarter revenue guidance appears conservative, according to Sacconaghi, who said the below-seasonal growth was due to unusual iPhone channel inventory replenishment in the second quarter and iPhone push-out from the first quarter into the second quarter, rather than an indication of slowing demand.While Sacconaghi expected modest downward revisions from consensus to FY23 estimates, he believed double-digit services growth was achievable in the next few years, despite more muted growth for advertising and the App Store.Price action: Shares of Apple are trading 4.85% higher to $173.84, according to Benzinga Pro.Read Next: AMC Entertainment Pops Higher On Q1 Earnings: What To Watch As The Stock Heads Toward Key LevelPhoto: ShutterstockEarningsAnalyst RatingsOptionsDividendsIPOsClick to see more Earnings updates© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Apple Inc gained 4.4% on better-than-expected results, helped by strong iPhone sales and notable inroads in India and other newer markets, fuelling a near 2% advance in technology stocks. Investors appeared to take in stride data showing US employers boosted hiring in April while raising wages, pointing to sustained labor market strength that could prompt the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates higher for some time. The Labor Department's report showed non-farm payrolls increased by 253,000 last month, higher than economists' expectations of 180,000. Wages increased 4.4% year-on-year in April after climbing 4.3% in March, while the unemployment rate fell to 3.4%.Also ReadApple opens its first official store in Mumbai; what we know so farApple BKC Mumbai store previewed ahead of April 18 opening: See picturesHere's a first look of the Apple store that opens in Mumbai tomorrowApple's Delhi store now open for public: 5 things you need to know about itApple posts record quarter in India; Cook says 'incredibly exciting market'Buddha inspired me to renounce violence, just like Ashoka: Nepal PMPakistan's Ex-PM Imran to face indictment on May 10 in Toshakhana caseCovid-19 no longer represents a global health emergency, says WHOVice-President Dhankhar reaches London for King Charles III's CoronationUS job growth beats expectations in April; unemployment rate falls to 3.4% ""This is a strong report and shows that the labor market is resilient. It bails out the Fed for raising another quarter point,"" said Peter Cardillo, chief market economist at Spartan Capital Securities. ""It's been a tough week for the stock market, the regional banking problems have raised the fear factor, but Apple earnings came in strong. Stocks are coming up from near-term oversold condition."" Traders are betting the Fed will start easing the policy rate by September, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool, compared with July before the release of the jobs data. The Fed raised its interest rate by 25 basis points as expected on Wednesday, but Chair Jerome Powell noted it was too early to say with certainty that the rate-hike cycle was over as inflation remains the chief concern. Wall Street fell on Thursday after PacWest Bancorp's move to explore strategic options deepened concerns about the health of regional banks, pulling down shares of peers and big banks such as JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo & Co. PacWest rebounded on Friday with a 48.3% gain, while Western Alliance Bancorp bounced back 32.0%. Western Alliance on Thursday denied a report that it was exploring a potential sale. At 9:48 a.m. ET, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 459.05 points, or 1.39%, at 33,586.79, the S&P 500 was up 50.85 points, or 1.25%, at 4,112.07, and the Nasdaq Composite was up 141.80 points, or 1.19%, at 12,108.20. Following upbeat results from megacap companies, analysts expect profits for S&P 500 companies in the first quarter to decline 0.9% from a year earlier, according to Refinitiv data, compared with a 5.1% drop expected at the start of April. Used-car retailer Carvana Co jumped 30.8% as it expects to post a profit in the current quarter and plans to further bring down excess used-car inventory. Lyft Inc slumped 19% as the ride-hailing company's strategy to claw back market share from rival Uber Technologies Inc with lower fares stoked concerns about a hit to its profit margins. Advancing issues outnumbered decliners for a 6.06-to-1 ratio on the NYSE and a 3.47-to-1 ratio on the Nasdaq. The S&P index recorded four new 52-week highs and two new lows, while the Nasdaq recorded 37 new highs and 43 new lows.

Apple raised its dividend for the 11th consecutive year. The stock remains a buy. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More The iPhone continues to generate remarkably robust sales, even in the face of headwinds. What happened Shares of Apple (AAPL 1.56%) are ending the week on a high note, gaining as much as 5.1%. As of 10:53 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 4.8%. The broader market was solidly in rally mode, which no doubt contributed to tech giant's rise. However, the biggest news was Apple's quarterly results, which were far better than many feared. So what In its fiscal second quarter (ended April 1), Apple generated revenue of $94.8 billion, down 3% year over year, resulting in earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52, level with the year-ago period. Apple shareholders breathed a sigh of relief, having feared the combination of high inflation, rising interest rates, and continued economic uncertainty would have weighed more heavily on sales. To put the results in the context of Wall Street's expectations, analysts' consensus estimates were calling for revenue of $92.9 billion and EPS of $1.43, so the tech titan cleared both hurdles with ease. Apple fans had other reasons to celebrate. Services was the highlight, with revenue rising to $20.9 billion -- an all-time record for the segment. iPhone sales also jumped, as revenue set a record of $51.3 billion, the highest ever for the fiscal second quarter. On the heels of its strong performance, Apple said it was raising its dividend to $0.24, an increase of 4%, payable on May 18 to shareholders of record as of the market close on May 15. This marks the 11th consecutive annual increase. The company also announced an additional $90 billion share repurchase plan, which will entitle remaining shareholders to an incrementally larger slice of its profits. Now what Naysayers have been waiting for the other shoe to drop, but Apple continues to largely defy the downturn. CEO Tim Cook suggested that consumer demand was holding up well and was particularly strong in emerging markets. Given the current economic headwinds, Apple was reticent to provide many specifics for the upcoming quarter, but analysts' consensus estimates are calling for revenue of $84.5 billion, an increase of about 2%, and EPS of $1.20, essentially flat. The consistent strength of Apple's business in the face of headwinds is a remarkable achievement. Its strong performance, industry-leading position, and shareholder-friendly practices make the stock a buy. Danny Vena has positions in Apple. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple.

Duggan, Benzinga Staff Writer  May 5, 2023 11:19 AM |  2 min read Zinger Key PointsWarren Buffett is known for his brutal honesty and pragmatic approach to investing.Wall Street will be paying close attention to anything Buffett says about the banking sector.Billionaire investing legend Warren Buffett is set to host the Berkshire Hathaway, Inc (NYSE: BRK-A) (NYSE: BRK-B) annual shareholder meeting in his hometown of Omaha, Nebraska, on Saturday.Not only will investors be watching closely to see what Buffett says about Berkshire, but they will also be paying attention to Buffett's take on the economy, the banking crisis, inflation and any other topics he is likely to cover at the meeting.What To Watch: Berkshire investors will first be looking for the company's first-quarter earnings numbers. Analysts are expecting Berkshire to report quarterly adjusted EPS of $3.16 and revenue of $77.55 billion. That number would represent 12.7% revenue growth from a year ago.Related Link: Understanding The Investor Sentiment Cycle: Your Emotions Are Your Worst Enemy Beyond the top and bottom-line numbers, Wall Street will be paying close attention to anything Buffett says about the banking sector. Bank of America Corp BAC is Berkshire's second-largest stock holding, and the company also has large stakes in Citigroup Inc C, Bank of New York Mellon Corp BK and UBS Group AG UBS.Buffett may also discuss his largest holding, Apple, Inc. AAPL, which traded higher on Friday following an earnings beat. Buffett may also address a number of general topics, such as his outlook for the economy, his thoughts on the Federal Reserve's monetary policy or his long-running bearishness on Bitcoin BTC/USD. Related Link: Tesla Reportedly Taps BYD Batteries To Power Model Y EVs In Germany Berkshire shareholders will be voting on six proposals on Saturday, all of which Buffett opposes. The proposals include a call for Berkshire to report on addressing climate change annually, and a proposal to remove Buffett from the chairman position. Buffett currently holds 32% of Berkshire's voting power, making it extremely unlikely any of the proposals will pass.Benzinga's Take: Buffett is known for his brutal honesty and pragmatic approach to investing. Federal Reserve officials, politicians and banking industry executives have all said the banking system is stable, but Buffett's take on the crisis and the credit markets could carry a lot of weight on Wall Street.Read Next: Western Alliance Stock Bounces Back After Bank Denies Reports Of Potential Sale, Alleges Short Sellers Involved: 'Shameful And Irresponsible'Photo: Shutterstock© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Cook is betting that those markets will provide more opportunities for growth, with their youthful populations and relatively few iPhones. Shares of Apple rose more than 4% on Friday, putting the world's most valuable company on track for gains of around $120 billion in market capitalization. Apple said iPhone sales rose 1.5% to $51.3 billion for its fiscal second quarter even as global smartphone shipments fell 13% in January to March, according to research firm Canalys, whose data showed Apple gained market share from Android phones. Apple said it set sales records in several countries across South Asia, Latin America and the Middle East.Also ReadAhead of Saket store launch, Apple CEO Tim Cook to meet PM Modi todayApple opens its first official store in Mumbai; what we know so farCEO Tim Cook may visit India to launch Apple's first store in the countryApple India: Excited to build on our long-standing history, says Tim CookApple posts record quarter in India; Cook says 'incredibly exciting market'In a bid to make chat interesting WhatsApp introduces single-vote pollsGoogle to introduce Bard AI as homescreen widget on Pixel devicesSellers set to launch big discounts on smartphones to clear stockFirst two retail stores in India 'milestone' for Apple: CEO Tim CookApple, Samsung captures 96% of global smartphone operating profits ""We're putting efforts in a number of these markets and really see, particularly given our low share and the dynamics of the demographics, a great opportunity for us in those markets,"" Cook told investors during a conference call. India is perhaps Apple's biggest focus. The company recently opened its first two retail stores there, in Mumbai and Delhi, and while Apple does not disclose revenue for the country, Cook told investors that it set a quarterly record and percentage growth was in very strong double digits year-over-year. ""There are a lot of people coming into the middle class, and I really feel that India is at a tipping point, and it's great to be there,"" Cook said on the conference call. Apple was the second biggest revenue generating brand in India in 2022, second only to Samsung as it gained 18% of the total value of smartphone shipments, according to research firm Counterpoint. For Apple, selling an iPhone in an emerging market represents more than just the sale of one device - it represents the chance to get consumers hooked on Apple devices and services over time. Customers who start with an iPhone might later add an Apple Watch or AirPods or sign up for subscription services. Cook said he saw opportunities for Apple in India in services but said that average revenue per user - a metric known as ARPU in the subscription business - would take time to catch up to Apple's other markets. USED IPHONE BOOM Part of the reason that Apple has been able to gain market share in both emerging and developed markets is the emergence of a booming market for used iPhones. Sales of refurbished iPhones rose 16% in volume globally during 2022. India led the growth with a 19% jump, according to Counterpoint, with iPhones accounting for 11% of secondary smartphone sales in India. In an interview with Reuters on Thursday, Apple's Cook said little of Apple's direct iPhone revenue comes from refurbished devices. However he said the company has tried to bolster the used iPhone market by offering trade-in deals on its iPhones and building them sturdy enough to last several owners. ""We encourage the market and it provides us an opportunity to hit some price points that we would not otherwise play in,"" Cook said in the interview.

Ongoing concerns of a slowdown in iPhone sales were put to rest on Thursday after Apple reported solid earnings results that exceeded analyst expectations on both the top and bottom line.While revenues declined for the second quarter in a row, falling about 3% year-over-year, the company's quarterly iPhone sales exceeded $51 billion, which beat analyst estimates by $2.5 billion. The strong sales in iPhone helped offset weakness in Apple's Mac and iPad divisions. For future growth, investors are looking forward to Apple's expected September launch of the iPhone 15, as well as its expansion into India, which the company mentioned nearly 20 times on its earnings call.Also giving Apple investors confidence is the company's announcement of a new $90 billion stock buyback program and a 4% increase to the company's quarterly dividend, to $0.24 per share. Shares of Apple jumped more than 5% on Friday, adding $135 billion to the company's market value, which stood at about $2.77 trillion.Here's how three Wall Street analysts reacted to Apple's solid earnings results.Wedbush: ""Lebron-like results from Cupertino.""Rating: Outperform, $205 price target""Cook & Co. delivered an impressive iPhone beat and gave a relatively upbeat outlook going forward that should give the Street further confidence that Cupertino is riding out this macro storm in Rock of Gibraltar-like fashion. An uptick in China demand speaks to further share gains that Apple is seeing with iPhone 14 Pro along with higher ASPs globally that we believe is now in the $900+ level giving Apple tailwinds in this market... Overall, Cook talked about a stable consumer demand environment with particular strength in emerging markets as Apple continues to aggressively bet on a number of key markets with India front and center,"" Wedbush said. JPMorgan: ""Negating Macro Headwinds with Execution.""Rating: Overweight, $190 price target""The results and guidance are exactly what investors were looking for from the company to feel reassured of its defensive positioning and at the same time the greater resilience of Big Tech in general in the current macro as well as on potential further macro deterioration, making it palpable to still keep paying 26x NTM earnings for AAPL shares. While we can see some investors squirm about a 26x earnings multiple, we believe the resilience of the business proving out in the numbers currently as well as the early part of the pandemic (2020) will amply justify the reasons to pay a premium,"" JPMorgan said.Goldman Sachs: ""iPhone continues to gain share.""Rating: Buy, $209 price target""We gain confidence in our Buy rating and believe AAPL shares continue to be attractive. First, the iPhone beat was driven by recapture of lost sales due to earlier supply issues as well as better-than-expected performance in developing markets... Second, Services revenue grew +5% yoy with all-time revenue records in App Store, Music, iCloud, and payments, continuing to prove Services to be a reliable source of long-term growth... Third, AAPL's generous shareholder capital return program continues to support the stock,"" Goldman Sachs said. Read next MI Exclusive Apple Apple stock More...

Δ Garrett Baldwin This morning, the Labor Department released its monthly update on U.S. jobs. The general expectation was for slower job growth in April, with around 178,000 new jobs. What we got was much, much more; nonfarm payrolls rose by 253,000. Unemployment is running at 3.4%, below predictions, and is tied for the lowest level since 1969. The key focus, though, is wage growth: Is the Fed's policy of raising interest rates doing enough to cool off wage inflation? The numbers suggest... no. Average hourly earnings rose 0.5% for the month, up 4.4% from 2022. (While all this is happening, Sen. Bernie Sanders is now trying to more than double the minimum wage from $7.25 to $17.00.) Regardless of the news, we are looking today for reversion trades on just about every high-volume stock with options that we can get our hands on. On Fridays, specifically, we want to trade the SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) and the Invesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ), which tracks the Nasdaq 100, alongside a host of stocks like Ford Motor Co. (F) and Apple Inc. (AAPL). This chart shows how we'll pick our shot... Sign up for SMS so you never miss special events, exclusive offers, and weekly bonus trades. We are looking for stocks to ""revert"" off the second standard deviation band that you see below. It happened yesterday at 10:30 AM, and 12 PM, allowing traders to either trade the SPY, the leveraged Direxion Daily S&P 500 Bull 3X Shares (SPXL), or options on the SPY that expired at the end of the day. This strategy, which I'll outline later today, can be a really great way to mix risk-reward during  Friday trading sessions.

Here's What I'm Watching Today (May 5, 2023) Contagion: There are plenty of people now dancing on the grave of PacWest Bancorp (PACW), Western Alliance Bancorporation (WAL), and Bank of Hawaii Corp. (BOH). But we've reached a point where the insanity has translated into outright danger. It's important to stress that PacWest isn't exactly a crypto-bank with Barney Frank on the board of directors. It's brick-and-mortar operation, with quality loans with long-term relationships. If this spreads to a bank like PacWest, it can spread anywhere. There are two major forces at play here that require examination immediately. First, it's the basic nature of fractional reserve banking. But second, it's the advantages that the TBTF banks have over everyone else. A bank like PacWest takes deposits, puts money into safe Treasury bills, and, maybe, gets a 4.5% yield on the one-month T-bill. That's how long they'll wait for money... But a TBTF bank like JPMorgan Chase & Co. (JPM) (which has close to si… Join the conversation.

9:40 AM |  3 min read Apple Inc AAPL experienced its overall sales falling for the second consecutive quarter but still managed to exceed top and bottom line estimates due to recovered iPhone sales. Fiscal Second Quarter EarningsDuring the quarter that ended on April 1st, Apple’s revenue slipped 3% from $97.28 billion in the prior quarter to $94.84 billion, topping Refinitiv’s consensus of $92.96 billion. As a result, Apple made a net income of $24.16 billion compared to $25.01 billion in the year-earlier period.  The resulting EPS was $1.52 per share, topping the expected $1.43.Product Segmentation As CEO Tim Cook summed up, it was quite a good quarter from an iPhone point of view that generated $51.33 billion in revenue, especially when looked at market statistics as broader smartphone industry contracted nearly 15% during the period, according to an IDC estimate. StreetAccount consensus expected $48.84 billion. With iPhone revenue increasing 2% during the quarter, it is suggested that supply shortages and disruptions that have been plaguing the product for last few years have finally subsided. On the other hand, Mac and iPad didn’t score so well but Apple warned when it reported its previous quarter of this decline, they just fell more than expected. Mac generated $7.17 billion in revenue, below the expected $7.80 billion while iPad brought in $6.67 billion as revenue dropped almost 13% YoY, also below StreetAccount’s estimate of $6.69 billion. Although Mac sales dropped more than 31% YoY, it should be noted that this is a comparison to a period when Apple still benefited from the last days of the pandemic boom. Also, there’s the fact that Apple shifted to using its own chips that brought a longer laptop battery life. Other Products generated $8.76 billion in revenue, exceeding the expected $8.43 billion while services brought in $20.91 billion, below the expected$20.97 billion but marking an increase of 5.5% YoY which suggest that Apple’s focus to its highest-margin business is paying off. While sales contracted in most regions, Asia Pacific expanded to $8.11 billion.Outlook Cook announced that Apple is still resisting to layoffs which are the last resort. Meanwhile, Cook’s growth bet is on emerging markets such as India where Apple is luring away Android phone users. Apple recently open its first two stores in the country, in Mumbai and Delhi respectively. Apple managed to beat the odds and find new opportunities in a heavily hit market.Meanwhile, Qualcomm Inc QCOM outlook is now grim with Apple being its largest purchaser of standalone modem chips. On Wednesday, Qualcomm gave lower than expected forecasts for its third quarter revenue and profit as it expects the smartphone industry to take longer to use up excess chips before new orders for fresh ones come in. Although Qualcomm is hoping for smartphone sales to recover in China during the second half of the year, this market was among the first to be slashed by high inflation that weakened consumer spending and consequently, lowered the demand on discretionary goods such as electronics. Qualcomm’s CEO Cristiano Amon also noted that used phones are also replacing the sales of premium-tier devices. Back in 2022, Apple’s sales of refurbished iPhones confirmed this trend as they rose 16% across the globe.         RecapApple came out on top of the earnings week thanks to stronger than expected iPhone sales that make up more than half of its total revenue. It also achieved an all-time record in services with the March quarter record for iPhone in an extremely challenging macroeconomic environment. DISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Apple Earnings: iPhone Sales Hit Record Highs By Danny Vena – May 5, 2023 at 9:39AM Key Points Apple delivered a March-quarter record for iPhone sales and an all-time record for services. The company announced its eleventh consecutive dividend increase. The stock remains a remarkable value -- when viewed in the context of its continue strong performance. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Despite multiple headwinds, demand for the iPhone remains high. Given the challenging environment, which includes economic uncertainty, high inflation, and rising interest rates, it isn't a stretch to say people are finding ways to spend less. A recent survey of more than 9,000 consumers found that 69% of respondents planned to cut back on nonessential spending, with 15% planning to eliminate nonessential spending altogether, according to a study by PwC. Investors have been concerned about the potential implications for Apple (AAPL 1.56%). After all, the company's high-end goods are considered by many to be a luxury, as the average price of an iPhone reached $988 last quarter, according to research firm CIRP. Yet Apple's results yesterday showed the enduring demand for the iPhone, which helped backstop the company's performance amid challenging conditions. Image source: Apple. Demand is strong despite headwinds For its fiscal second quarter (ended April 1), Apple generated revenue of $94.8 billion and while that was down 3% year over year, it was well ahead of analysts' consensus estimates of $92.9 billion. The key driver of the strong topline performance was iPhone revenue of $51.3 billion -- a record for the March quarter. Apple's flagship device generated revenue that was well ahead of expectations, as Wall Street had forecast iPhone sales of $48.7 billion. The iPhone continues to be the backbone of Apple's business, accounting for 54% of total sales during the quarter. Perhaps as importantly, strong pricing power helped Apple deliver robust profits as well, with earnings per share (EPS) of $1.52 unchanged compared to the prior-year quarter, even as revenue edged lower. This was also markedly better than the $1.43 market watchers expected. Another headliner was services, a recurring revenue stream that Apple has been curating for the past several years -- fueled by the growing number of iPhones currently in use. Services revenue of $20.9 billion hit an all-time record, accounting for 22% of sales, also demonstrating resilience in the face of headwinds. Demand for the Mac didn't hold up as well, with sales of $7.2 billion falling 31%. The appetite for the iPad was similarly strained, with sales of $6.7 billion down about 13%. In typical Apple fashion, and without providing any specifics, CEO Tim Cook dropped this nugget: ""We are pleased to ... have our installed base of active devices reach an all-time high."" While the company was mum as to the number of devices, we know it's higher than the 2 billion active devices it announced just last quarter. Services continued to generate strong growth -- and part of that is a function of the growing number of devices fueling that demand. Shareholders rejoice Strong sales and cost discipline give Apple the resources to continue its tradition of shareholder-friendly practices -- which was on full display. Apple's board of directors declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share, an increase of 4%. This marks the eleventh consecutive increase since Apple reinstituted its payout back in 2012. The payout began at a split-adjusted rate of roughly $0.095, increasing by an impressive 153% since inception. While the yield appears low at just 0.55%, that's a function of Apple's spectacular growth (more on that in a minute). The company isn't stopping there. Given Apple's strong operating cash flow of $28.6 billion, the board has also authorized an additional $90 billion stock buyback, which will increase the proportion of profits allocated to each share -- further enriching Apple investors. Remarkable value Apple continues to buck the broader market trend, with its stock down just 9% from its peak reached in early 2022. Yet considering its resilience, Apple stock is still a solid value, selling for just 28 times earnings, compared to a price-to-earnings ratio of 24 for the S&P 500. While that's slightly more expensive, consider this: over the past decade, Apple stock has gained 929%, and generated total gains of 1,110% when factoring in the dividend. Comparing that to the S&P's total return of 207% during the same period, helps illustrate not only that Apple's premium is well-deserved, but also what a compelling buy the stock is at this price. Danny Vena has positions in Apple. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Club holding Apple (AAPL) delivered better-than-expected quarterly results Thursday, with its installed base of active devices expanding to more than 2 billion. Apple's board authorized a program to repurchase up to $90 billion worth of stock, while raising its quarterly dividend to 24 cents a share. 2. A slate of banks increased their price targets on Apple on Friday. These included Morgan Stanley, which raised its target to $185 per share, from $180, and Deutsche Bank which lifted its target to $180, from $170. Both firms reiterated the equivalent of buy ratings. Piper Sandler, meanwhile, was an outlier — lowering its price target on Apple to $180, from $195, even as it maintained an overweight rating on shares. 3. Shares of Club name Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) closed up more than 6% Thursday on a Bloomberg report that Microsoft (MSFT), another Club stock, is helping the chipmaker expand into artificial intelligence processors. 4. Club holding Coterra Energy ( CTRA) delivered a first-quarter earnings beat Thursday, while reaffirming its commitment to regularly return at least half of its free cash to shareholders. Currently, Coterra said it plans to return a total of $420 million to shareholders, representing about 76% of its free cash flow in the first quarter. 5. Barclays raised its price target on Bausch + Lomb (BLCO) to $18 a share, from $17, citing its ""attractive growth profile."" The firm maintained an equal weight rating on BLCO shares. The eye-health products company holds the key to saving Club holding Bausch Health (BHC), which is in the process of unravelling its majority stake . 6. JPMorgan raised its price target on Kellogg (K) to $72 a share, from $68, while upgrading its rating to neutral, from underweight. The firm cited improved fundamentals at the food manufacturing giant. 7. DoorDash (DASH) received three price target raises following strong first-quarter earnings. Barclays increased its target to $75 a share, from $70, and maintained an equal weight rating. UBS lifted to $70 a share, from $68, maintaining a neutral rating. Oppenheimer raised to $85 a share, from $80, and reiterated an outperform rating. 8. Shares of Peloton Interactive (PTON) closed down more than 13% Thursday after the company reported a greater-than-expected loss for its fiscal third quarter — though, the reason why remains impenetrable. 9. Manufacturing firm Parker-Hannifin (PH) delivered a quarterly earnings beat Thursday, and there is no sign of a slowdown. Baird on Friday raised its price target on PH to to $415 a share, from $411, while maintaining an outperform rating on the stock. 10. Wells Fargo raised its price target on Royal Caribbean Cruises (RCL) to $88 a share, from $78, and kept its overweight rating on the stock. The firm cited ""robust"" cruise demand and RCL management's solid execution following the company's first-quarter results. (See here for a full list of the stocks in Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust.)

Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. Not overbought yet Wynn downgraded Amazon is about margins 1. Market is not overbought yet U.S. stocks rose Thursday, led by the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite , which has outperformed the S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all year long. Club holdings Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) helped fuel the gains. The market hasn't quite entered overbought territory yet, but that may happen if the broader rally persists. ""As we get overbought, I want [Club members] to be more careful,"" Jim Cramer said. Before the market open, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims in the week ended June 3 totaled 261,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, well above the Dow Jones estimate of 235,000. 2. Wait on Wynn Jim said he's not ready to pound the table on Wynn Resorts (WYNN) just yet. The casino operator fell more than 1% on Tuesday after Jefferies downgraded the stock to hold from buy and reduced its price target to $114 per share from $135. Jim said he recognizes that China's post-Covid recovery hasn't lived up to expectations, carrying implications for Wynn's business in Macao, a special administrative region of China. However, Jim said he sees continued strength in Wynn's Las Vegas operations. 3. Own Amazon for margins Research analysts at competing Wall Street firms published fresh research on Amazon, with different focuses in the notes. Wells Fargo expressed optimism around the tech giant's ability to expand margins in its crucial North American business, while UBS touted a reacceleration of AWS revenue growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Both firms have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon stock. While we also believe an artificial intelligence-powered AWS reacceleration looms , Jim said he's partial to Wells Fargo's emphasis on margins. ""That is the call,"" he said. ""If you own it [Amazon] for AI, that will prove to be disappointing to you,"" he added. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AMZN, AAPL, MSFT and WYNN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Alex Coffey June 8, 2023 11:22 AM |  8 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Thursday market open) Smoke isn’t the only thing blowing in from Canada this week. A rate hike north of the border raised concerns on Wall Street, but by and large the market still seems confident of a Federal Reserve rate pause next Wednesday.The small-cap focused Russell 2000® (RUT) rose to a three-month high yesterday even as previously sizzling sectors like info tech and communication services lost ground. The Bank of Canada’s quarter-point rate hike Wednesday likely played into tech weakness, raising concerns the Fed might follow suit. Higher bond yields both at home and abroad also might reflect Canada’s move.Even before the Canada news, there had been pullback lately in some of the mega-cap stocks that propelled this year’s rally. Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT recently hit 52-week highs, as did semiconductor firm Nvidia NVDA. All three are well below water so far this week and suffered sharp losses Wednesday. It’s possible some profit-taking occurred after their performance far outpaced the rest of the market year-to-date. Apple and Microsoft both lost more ground overnight, but major indexes were mixed in premarket trading.These mega-caps often set the entire market’s direction, so watch them closely the next few days to see if buyers come in at the lower prices or if selling continues. Also keep an eye on market volume, which was higher than normal yesterday. Heavier volume can sometimes indicate a stronger sense of conviction among market participants. Volume was generally light last month as major indexes rose to nine-month highs, but it was notably heavy Wednesday as tech stocks lost ground.On the “cup is half full” side, however, advancers outpaced decliners yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and new 52-week highs outpaced new 52-week lows, Briefing.com says.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) climbed 2 basis points to the high end of its recent range at 3.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) continued easing from recent highs to 103.8. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures rose slightly to 14.09 but remain near three-year lows. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) has been climbing this week and recently traded at $73.22 per barrel. Just inThis week has been a “news vacuum,” according to one Wall Street analyst. However, today brings tidings in the form of initial weekly jobless claims. They spiked to 261,000, well above analysts’ expectations for 237,000 and close to the highest level this year. Higher claims tend to indicate a slowing labor market, but it would likely take several weeks or even months to be a trend. Generally, the market associates recessions with claims of 300,000 or more. Still, Treasury yields eased immediately after the data.In other news, Eurozone Q1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised to -0.1% compared to the earlier estimate of 0.1% growth. Q4 growth also got checked, with the new estimate at -0.1%. That puts Europe technically into a small recession, Trading Economics observes.Eye on the FedChances of an interest rate pause at the June meeting stand at 71% this morning, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which also prices in a nearly 70% chance that rates will rise by July. These numbers haven’t moved much the last few days, reinforcing ideas that a pause is likely next week.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starts next Tuesday—the very day of the critical May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The Fed will announce its decision next Wednesday afternoon.Northern lights: Western central banks often, though not always, raise and lower rates in unison. This month might be one of those times when they don’t. The Bank of Canada’s quarter-point rate hike Wednesday after a long pause surprised U.S. market participants and probably was partially responsible for the info tech sector’s poor performance yesterday, as that sector is often more sensitive to rate worries.Concern showed up more in the equities market than in fed funds futures, which still indicate strong chances for a Fed pause next week, only slightly lower than they did before the news from up north.While Canada’s economy often moves in parallel with its southern neighbor, Canada’s consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.7% in April. That inflation reading far exceeded economists’ expectations and compared with 0.4% in the United States. Canada wasn’t the only former British territory to jack up rates this week. Australia’s central bank raised its benchmark rate to an 11-year high.What to WatchNo drum roll: Friday is another day with no major data release on the calendar, and Monday doesn’t look much more exciting. That means anyone who loves watching numbers will have to be patient and wait for the deluge of data later next week.Sick day: Remember that a quiet market sometimes can be more prone to moving on outside influences like geopolitics or even the weather. One development drawing attention this week is an outbreak of COVID-19 in China. That might not have attracted much notice if things were busier on Wall Street. China’s recent economic data has been mixed as the country reopens from its pandemic lockdown. Any signs of the illness returning raises concerns about the possible impact on China’s growth, as well as its import demand. Cases are expected to peak at only 25% of the last wave, and so far there’s been only a slight moderation in activity based on anecdotal reports and high-frequency mobility measures such as subway traffic, according to the Schwab Center for Financial Research.Stocks in the SpotlightSoup and crackers: It’s said hot soup can refresh on a summer day, but Campbell CPB shares cooled yesterday after the company delivered earnings that some analysts labeled as disappointing.On the surface things looked about right as Campbell beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates, reported in-line revenue, and reaffirmed previous guidance. But the earnings beat was only half of what the company delivered earlier this year, Briefing.com notes. And the company’s Meals and Beverages segment saw revenue fall 2%—a somewhat puzzling result considering there is a durable eat-at-home trend, according to retail sector analysts.The snacks category, which includes those ubiquitous Goldfish crackers, was strong in the quarter, rising 12%. Salty snacks remained popular, it seems, even if the soup spoons stayed in the drawer.Unwinding: Over the last year, the S&P Real Estate Select Sector Index ($IXRE) is down more than 15% while the S&P Info Tech Select Sector Index (IXT) is up more than 19%, forming the top and bottom sectors on the one-year scorecard. This week there’s been a slight unwinding of that huge gap, with real estate hustling higher and tech giving up some gains. CHART OF THE DAY: ROLE REVERSAL. Over the last year, the S&P 500’s real estate sector ($IXRE—candlesticks) has been the worst sector performer and info tech (IXT—purple line) has been the best. This week, real estate is gaining and tech is losing ground. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investUnrefreshing pause? As “pause” ideas build ahead of next week’s FOMC meeting, prepare for possible hawkish language as a side dish. Assuming the Fed does pause, it’s possible either the Fed’s statement or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference could include wording designed to stamp out expectations that a pause may lead to a cut. The fear of a rate-driven recession hasn’t vanished, even with recent talk on the financial networks about chances for a “soft landing.” While cyclical sectors like financials, materials, and industrials showed signs of emerging from slumber this week, possibly due to pause hopes, the same sectors could face a headwind if “Fedspeak” associated with the meeting takes a negative tone. We’ve seen many times when a Fed decision and statement initially send markets up before selling emerges during the Powell press conference.Summer breeze: So-called market “internals” improved recently, according to Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. That’s essentially the opposite of what we’ve seen most of the year in terms of metrics like stocks making 52-week highs and stocks trading at or above their respective 200-day moving averages. The more evidence of positive developments on this type of measure, the “healthier” the market will look. That could conceivably aid investor sentiment and provide a tailwind for sectors outside the info tech/communications services heavyweights driving most of this year’s rally. For this to happen, he says, would require less stress in the banking environment, a delayed start of the recession, and further clarity on the path of monetary policy.Sticker shock: One major inflation “driver” over the last two years is the automobile market. Potential car buyers received good news yesterday but it might not have much impact on Fed policy. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index declined 2.7% month-over-month in May, following a 3% fall in April. Year-on-year, prices for used cars fell 7.6%—the biggest annual drop in four months, Trading Economics says. While this might play into next week’s inflation data, it’s likely not enough evidence of receding inflation to satisfy the Fed. Keep in mind that Fed is less concerned about goods inflation and more focused on a price measure known as Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) core services ex-housing, which strips out anything related to commodities, housing, and goods. Cars, obviously, are goods, not services—unless you decide to Uber.CalendarJune 9: No major earnings or data.June 12: No major earnings or dataJune 13: May Consumer Price Index (CPI), beginning of FOMC’s two-day meeting.June 14: FOMC rate decision and May Producer Price Index (PPI).June 15: May Retail Sales, May Industrial Production, June Empire State Manufacturing, and expected earnings from Kroger (KR). TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

US stocks are in the firing line if China’s economy stalls further Analysis by Nicole Goodkind, CNN Updated 10:35 AM EDT, Thu June 8, 2023 Link Copied!

You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. New York CNN — Chinese economic activity has hit a soft spot in recent weeks and Hong Kong’s equity markets have flirted with bear territory as a result. That’s also bad news for US companies with major exposure to China — and a number of S&P 500 companies stand first in the line of fire if the situation worsens. What’s happening: China’s swift economic reopening in December after three years of severe pandemic restrictions was hailed as a catalyst that would send global growth into overdrive. Pent-up consumer demand and a resurgence of manufacturing by the world’s second-largest economy is expected to drive about 35% of the world’s growth in 2023, according to recent projections from the International Monetary Fund. China’s reopening has had positive effects: Factories had their best month in nearly 11 years in February and the country’s economy grew by 4.5% in the first quarter of the year. But recent data shows such positivity may have been short-lived. Chinese exports fell 7.5% year over year in May as global demand weakened. Recent data shows that China is also contending with worse-than-expected consumer spending, slowing manufacturing and weak home sales. Youth unemployment has hit 20% in urban areas, according to official data, a record high. Growing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing have spooked investors, driving market volatility. A recent crackdown on American consulting companies like Bain, Capvision, Mintz Group and Micron Technology (MU) has worried multinational businesses, said US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns on Wednesday. “Investor views about China remain pessimistic, partly because of skepticism about near-term growth momentum and partly because of worries about the longer-term outlook,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Tuesday. China, home to more than 1.4 billion people, saw its population drop in 2022 for the first time in more than 60 years. A shrinking population means lower consumption. When Beijing made the announcement in January, global stocks were roiled. The Dow fell by 300 points and the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which follows Chinese firms on American exchanges, fell by 4%. What it means for markets: US-based companies doing business in China stand to lose if the economy continues on a downward trajectory. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Ford (F) and Tesla (TSLA) have large manufacturing ties to the country. Others, like Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike (NKE), rely on Chinese consumers. Earlier this year, Bank of America (BAC) compiled a list of the S&P 500 companies with the highest exposure to China. Topping the list was Las Vegas Sands (LVS), down nearly 6% this month, with 68% of its sales coming from China. Qualcomm (QCOM), with a 67% exposure rate to China, issued disappointing forward guidance during earnings last month, citing China’s slow recovery. Tesla, Intel, Nvidia (NVDA), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) were also among the 25 S&P 500 companies with the most exposure to China. Companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside of the United States saw an earnings decline rate of -10.2% in the first quarter of 2023, according to FactSet data. Companies that generated more than 50% of sales inside the United States, however, saw an earnings growth rate of 2.7%. Meanwhile, Chinese stocks trading in Hong Kong, just barely avoided entering bear territory this month: The Hang Seng index was down 19.6% on May 31 from its January high and the Golden Dragon China Index has fallen 5.6% so far this year. JD.com (JD), one of the largest Chinese companies trading in the United States, has fallen by nearly 36% this year. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group have both lowered their forecasts for Chinese equity indexes. The bright side: There’s still potential for upside, say economists. Analysts at Nomura and Barclays forecast Chinese economic growth of almost 8% for the second quarter. Ayaz Ebrahim, JPMorgan Chase’s emerging markets and Asia Pacific equities portfolio manager, recently said on Bloomberg TV that the bank is adding more shares of Chinese stocks to its portfolio in a bet that the Chinese government will back floundering companies and boost valuations. Wildfires drive air purifier stocks higher Wildfires in Canada have smothered large swaths of the United States in a thick plume of toxic smoke, leading to air quality warnings and advisories to stay inside. But fine particles from the smoke can make their way indoors. Air purifiers can be helpful with filtering out the pollution. Searches on Google have increased 16 fold since Monday, according to Google trends. Whirlpool (WHR), one of the largest home goods manufacturers in the world, has seen its stock surge 13.2% over the past five days and by 6.4% on Wednesday alone. The company says that its HEPA purifiers can remove up to 99.97% of bad particles from air. Shares of Carrier Global (CARR), which makes residential and industrial air purifiers and HVAC units, have gained nearly 11% over the past five days. Johnson Controls (JCI), which has a number of air filters on the market, has also seen its stock price soar. Shares are up by 8.5% over a five-day period. The air purifier market is poised to grow as climate change increases air pollution and exacerbates breathing difficulties. A Market Insights report forecasts that the industry is expected to grow at an annual compound rate of 10.8% to $2.9 billion by 2025, and $4.8 billion by 2030. Outdoor air pollution could cause 6 to 9 million premature deaths a year globally by 2060 and cost $2.6 trillion annually because of sick days, increased medical bills and reduced productivity, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report. Diageo CEO dies at 63 after short illness Sir Ivan Menezes, who served for a decade as chief executive of the largest spirits maker in the world, has died at age 63 after a short but aggressive illness. Diageo confirmed Menezes’ death on Wednesday, just two days after the company announced that he was stepping down as CEO following complications from an emergency surgery on an ulcer. Menezes was born in 1959 in Pune, India. He held UK and US citizenship, as well as overseas citizenship for India. He joined Diageo at its creation in 1997 and became CEO in July 2013. He was knighted in January by King Charles III for services to Business and to Equality. Prior to his illness, he was expected to retire at the end of June. COO Debra Crew, who was set to become CEO on July 1, will take on the role of interim chief executive, effective immediately. Menezes, who ran the $93 billion company behind Johnnie Walker whiskey, Smirnoff vodka, Guinness and Tanqueray gin, was well known as a champion of diversity in the workplace. About 40% of Diageo’s senior positions are held by women and 37% of its leaders are ethnically diverse. “Ivan was undoubtedly one of the finest leaders of his generation,” said Diageo chairman Javier Ferrán in a statement on Wednesday. “Ivan was there at the creation of Diageo and over 25 years, shaped Diageo to become one of the best performing, most trusted and respected consumer companies.” Under his leadership, Diageo’s market value nearly doubled from $52 billion to $93 billion. Menezes also successfully guided Diageo through the Covid-19 pandemic, delivering a net sales value 36% larger in 2023 than in 2019, Diageo said. Menezes also served as a non-executive director of Tapestry, chairman of the Council of The Scotch Whisky Association and as a member of the global advisory board of Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of Management.

However, Apple has rallied investors in 2023 with promising prospects in VR and AR. Meanwhile, Amazon has a lot to gain from a gradual easing of inflation. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These companies are excellent long-term options thanks to their solid positions in two crucial markets. After an economically challenging 2022, the stock market has been on a bull run this year. The Nasdaq Composite index has climbed 26% since Jan. 1 as easing inflation and technological advances have made investors bullish. However, many analysts believe the current optimism won't last forever, and the market will start trending down in the coming months as earnings slip from lingering macroeconomic hurdles. As a result, it's a good idea to use this time to invest in solid growth stocks that are likely to offer gains over the long term, no matter the economic climate. As the leaders of markets such as consumer electronics and e-commerce, Apple (AAPL 1.56%) and Amazon (AMZN 2.54%) are excellent options to fortify your portfolio in uncertain times. However, if you are only looking to add one stock right now, you'll need to know the better option. So, let's assess whether Apple or Amazon stock is the better buy. Apple Apple is a king in the consumer electronics market. The company has proved time and time again its ability to take existing technology and present it in a way that sends user adoption skyrocketing. Apple has done just this with smartphones, Bluetooth headphones, tablets, and smartwatches, achieving a leading market share in each of these sectors. The iPhone maker's dominance in consumer tech has seen its stock soar 272% in the last five years. As a result, the company's debut of a totally new product category at its Worldwide Developer Conference on June 5 makes for an exciting time to invest. Apple unveiled its Vision Pro virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset at the event. The new device is essentially an entire computer in headset form, meaning it doesn't need to be paired to an external device like a smartphone or computer. The Vision Pro has taken massive leaps in VR/AR, removing the need for controllers by using advanced eye tracking and hand gestures. People can use the headset for nearly any computing task, from word processing to browsing the web, video editing, FaceTime, and much more. Additionally, the Vision Pro provides immersive entertainment experiences for everything from movies to gaming, watching sports, and more. While many tech enthusiasts are excited about the new product, Wall Street seems unsure what to make of it primarily because of its eye-watering price of about $3,500. The high price point means the Vision Pro is not accessible to the average consumer just yet. As a result, an investment in Apple is for what this product can become a few generations down the line when cheaper options become available to the masses. However, considering the AR market is projected to hit $461 billion at a compound annual growth rate of 42% through 2030, Apple is well-positioned to profit substantially from the expanding industry. Amazon Amazon shares have risen 49% year to date as its e-commerce business has shown signs of rebounding after significant losses last year. The company's e-commerce segments reported a combined $10.6 billion in operating losses in fiscal 2022 as economic declines curbed consumer spending. However, investors were able to breathe a sigh of relief in Amazon's first quarter of 2023, with its North American segment returning to profitability and its international retail business reporting a slight improvement. The retail giant looks to be back on a growth path as inflation eases, and it has more to gain than most as the situation improves. Amazon holds a leading 38% market share in e-commerce, which could lead to a massive boost in revenue as the market recovers. Meanwhile, improving interest rates will likely allow businesses to increase cloud spending, bolstering the company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services. Amazon's potential is evident in its average 12-month price target of $138, which projects stock growth of 10%. The figure aligns with the company's five-year stock gains of 48%, making Amazon an attractive long-term option. Is Apple or Amazon stock the better buy? The choice between Amazon or Apple stock comes down to which is the more reliable buy ahead of potential economic challenges. In this case, Apple is the clear winner. Amid a sell-off in 2022, Amazon's stock fell 50% while Apple's declined a more moderate 27%. The maker of MacBooks and iPhones is home to a more resilient business thanks to consistent product demand. Moreover, Apple's price-to-earnings ratio of 30 compared to Amazon's 299 makes its stock a far bigger bargain. So if you're looking for value and reliability in the retail sector, Apple's stock is an attractive option this month.

Both Apple and Nvidia have some exciting next-gen growth opportunities to pursue that could ensure their businesses continue to grow in the years ahead. Idexx relies on more stable and consistent growth from a strong and resilient pet industry. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: IDXX Idexx Laboratories Market Cap $38B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.13%) $9.61 Current Price $460.48 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Have these stocks become too expensive to buy today? The Nasdaq is home to many of the best growth stocks in the world. Some of them have generated life-changing returns for investors, including Apple (AAPL 1.56%), Nvidia (NVDA 1.84%), and Idexx Laboratories (IDXX 2.13%). These stocks have all been 10-baggers over the past decade. Here's a closer look at these companies and whether they are still excellent investments today. 1. Apple In 10 years, shares of tech giant Apple have risen by more than 1,000%. If you'd invested only $10,000 in June 2013, it would be worth around $113,600 today. And that's investing at a time when Apple was already a big tech company known for its iPhones and growing ecosystem. Today, the company has a variety of different services, including music, streaming, books, news, and many others. Apple hasn't run out of ideas to grow, either. This month it unveiled Vision Pro, the company's augmented reality headset. Healthcare is another potential area of long-term growth for the business, as there have been rumors the company could be adding a blood glucose monitor on a future iteration of its Apple Watch. A company like Apple that gushes profits and free cash flow can afford to spend money on various ventures to see which one pays off. In the trailing 12 months, the company's free cash flow totaled more than $97 billion. That's why, despite being nearly worth $3 trillion, it may still not be too late to buy this behemoth, as Apple could have more growth opportunities to pursue in the future. At 28 times earnings, the growth stock isn't cheap -- but it's still not a big premium to own shares of a company that billionaire investor Warren Buffett says is ""probably the best business I know in the world."" 2. Nvidia Nvidia recently hit the $1 trillion valuation mark, as its stock has been rising sharply this year. Known for its video cards, Nvidia is a top name in computing, and the emergence of chatbot ChatGPT has only enhanced its popularity with investors. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the next new growth area for the business, with Nvidia recently launching an AI platform that it says offers ""full-stack innovation in computing, software, and AI models and services."" Nvidia's chips can also help companies build out their AI capabilities. The company forecast that for the current quarter (which ends in July), its sales will be around $11 billion -- smashing analyst expectations of $7.2 billion, leading to a rally in the stock's valuation. Demand has also been red hot for its data center products, fueling the company's strong numbers. Although its valuation has gone through the roof, with Nvidia's stock now trading at more than 80 times estimated future profits, it still has more upside to go as it promises to be a big name in AI. In 10 years, its shares have jumped by more than 10,000%, and a $10,000 investment a decade ago would be worth close to $1.1 million today. And remarkably, it may still make for a great long-term buy right now. 3. Idexx Laboratories Pet healthcare company Idexx Laboratories has given back some gains over the past few years, but its 10-year returns sit at just over 1,000%. A $10,000 investment in the stock a decade ago would now be worth around $107,000. The company has customers in over 175 countries, giving the business plenty of growth opportunities. Unlike the fast-growing tech and consumer stocks up higher on this list, Idexx's growth has been more constant and steady over the years: IDXX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. In 2023, for example, it's projecting revenue growth between 7.5% and 10%. On the bottom line, however, it's projecting up to 22% growth in earnings per share. The bulk of the company's revenue (approximately 92%) comes from the companion animal group segment, which includes veterinarian diagnostics products and services for pets. It also generates revenue from water testing products and livestock and poultry diagnostics. Spending on pets has risen over the years, ensuring demand for Idexx's products and services continues to increase. According to the American Pet Products Association, the U.S. pet market was worth $136.8 billion in 2022, representing a 51% increase from $90.5 billion in 2018. And this year it expects the market to rise to a value of $143.6 billion. With more spending still on the way, Idexx's business will remain strong. One obstacle that may keep investors from buying shares of Idexx, however, is the stock's hefty earnings multiple of around 60. Given the more modest growth opportunities in this industry, it may be hard to justify such a valuation for Idexx. David Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends Idexx Laboratories. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Airbnb is keeping pace with change in its industry, and results are soaring. Apple's flagship products continue to flourish, and it recently unveiled its Vision Pro. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: ABNB Airbnb Market Cap $79B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (5.71%) $6.73 Current Price $124.59 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These highly profitable growth stocks are just getting started. The market has already delivered its fair share of great and not-so-great days in 2023, but wonderful businesses are still showing investors that they have what it takes to win over the long run. It's important to remember that the share price of any given stock reflects how the market values it in a given moment. Share price can tell you a lot, but it doesn't tell you everything. Looking beyond share price at the underlying business and its core financials is how you discern whether you're looking at a great company with a clear path to growth ahead. If you're seeking two quality businesses that continue to deliver growth and profitability even in the current economy, you don't have to search far. Here are two household names that may be too good to pass up right now. 1. Airbnb Airbnb (ABNB 5.71%) has made a name for itself in the highly competitive yet fragmented travel industry, an effort that was by no means guaranteed success. However, in the roughly 15 years since Airbnb was founded as a small bed and breakfast in a living room in San Francisco, the company has evolved to such a scale that its platform captures roughly 20% of the entire vacation rental industry globally. Of course, Airbnbs today are used for far more than just short-term trips or leisure travel. People are staying in Airbnbs for longer periods and even living in these accommodations in some cases. As of the first quarter of 2023, guest reservations generated more than $20 billion in gross booking value. Almost half of all gross bookings were for stays of at least seven nights, while 18% of stays were long-term stays of 28 days or longer. That long-term stay figure was a slight deceleration from prior quarters, which was something management had predicted given the overall recovery in short-term stays now that borders have reopened after pandemic lockdowns. CEO Brian Chesky added some context to these developments in the company's first quarter earnings call: I do think there is some -- little bit of a post-pandemic equilibrium that you're starting to see, and we're also seeing a mix shift because cross-border urban nights are now up. That being said, I remain extremely bullish on long-term stays. I think this is going to be one of the big growth opportunities for Airbnb over the next five years. And the reason why is because people are permanently more flexible. Chesky also noted that one of the most prominent comments from users on the platform was about the cost of the long-term stays. The company has made more than a dozen upgrades to this travel segment in response, such as an automatic fee reduction for long-term bookings of more than three months. Guests can use buy now, pay later service Klarna when making reservations to reduce the upfront cost of a wide range of stay types. Airbnb also just launched an initiative called Airbnb Rooms, offering a new cost-effective category of accommodations where more than 80% of stays are less than $100 per night. Travel patterns have changed from the pre-pandemic era. Airbnb is continuing to demonstrate that it can efficiently (and profitably) adapt its business to cater to the changing needs of all kinds of travelers. Its cost-effective business structure remains remarkably asset-light because it connects travelers with hosts without needing to own or manage the actual properties. Investors might want to consider even a modest position in this resilient business. 2. Apple Apple (AAPL 1.56%) is hardly a new name to readers, but sometimes it's those tried-and-true businesses that investors will keep coming back to again and again. The tech behemoth, like other companies in its industry, is facing a challenging time as consumer spending patterns shift from goods to experiences and fears of a recession are still a potent reality. Although Apple's business covers a wide range of products and services, it still generates the lion's share of sales from its iPhones. Still, in the company's second quarter of its fiscal 2023, ended April 1, the company set a new record for iPhone sales, even as the difficulties of the current operating environment pushed overall net sales down slightly from one year ago. Another segment that continues to account for more and more of Apple's top line is its non-hardware services business. This includes subscriptions such as Apple Music and Apple TV+. It also covers products like Apple Pay, Apple Card, and even its newer buy now, pay later service. In the quarter, Apple brought in total net sales of $95 billion and net income of $24 billion. Of that total, $51 billion came from iPhone sales and $21 billion from its services business. Considering that Apple's services business is its most asset-light segment (its cost of sales was a mere $6 billion in the quarter compared to the $47 billion incurred from the products businesses), shareholders should watch the consistent headway this segment is making as the company's second-largest driver of sales. Apple is also making progress with its much-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which just debuted at the Worldwide Developers Conference and is expected to be released next year. The headset is expected to cost $3,499 a unit. It's likely to span a range of personal as well as professional use cases, integrating with other Apple products as well as a range of third-party apps. Apple just boosted its dividend by 4%, its 11th consecutive year of increasing its payout. It also returned a whopping $23 billion and some change to shareholders in the form of dividends in the March quarter. Even though the stock's dividend yield is less than 1% at the time of this writing, Apple's low payout ratio and consistent payout increases have made it popular with many income investors. Apple continues to demonstrate its relevancy and staying power with consumers amid the new waves of the digital age. For long-term shareholders, this is a business you can buy and hold on to forever.

The US stock market is unusually top heavy. Just two stocks, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, account for nearly 15 percent of the S&P 500 Index. Add smaller but still formidable giants Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Nvidia Corp, and that number climbs to 24 percent. That’s the highest concentration in the index’s top five holdings since at least 1990.One reason investors buy the broad market is to diversify the risk of owning too few stocks. But with five of them dominating the S&P 500, some investors may be wondering if buying a broad market index is too dicey. The short answer is that shifts in the index’s concentration don’t necessarily make it any more or less risky. In fact, it’s more likely the opposite — that those changes help stabilize the risk of investing over time.The longer answer lies in the way the S&P 500 is constructed. The index assigns weights to its constituents based on their market value so that more valuable companies receive a higher allocation than less valuable ones. That approach to weighting keeps a lid on risk because companies with larger market values tend to be safer than smaller ones — and as companies’ market value changes over time, their weighting in the S&P 500 goes up or down, leaving the overall risk of the index roughly unchanged.In 1990, for example, International Business Machines Corp. was the leading technology company in the world and Apple was an aspiring competitor, which is why IBM held the top spot in the S&P 500 and Apple ranked 107. Now the tables have turned, and so have the two companies’ ranks in the S&P 500, with Apple perched at the top and IBM demoted to 61, a risk adjustment that required no intervention from investors in the S&P 500.One way to see the relationship between risk and market value is to look at the interplay between market value and profits. The market famously prizes earnings above all else, not just because investing is a money-making endeavor but also because companies that make more money are generally sturdier businesses. Apple made $94 billion in net income during the past 12 months, while Fidelity National Information Services Inc., whose weight in the S&P 500 is a rounding error, lost more than $16 billion. It’s not hard to tell which company is the safer bet. Related stories Kerala Higher Education: The decline from meritocracy to mediocrity could soon become irreversibleRemote work pay cuts send the wrong messageECB inches nearer to the interest-rate summit The data show that market value and earnings power are closely, although not perfectly, related. The trailing 12-month net income of S&P 500 companies is strongly correlated with their market value (0.82) and weighting in the index (0.81). In other words, more often than not, the more money a company makes, the higher its market value and the larger its weighting in the S&P 500. (A correlation of 1 implies that two variables move perfectly in the same direction, whereas a correlation of negative 1 implies that two variables move perfectly in the opposite direction.)Not surprisingly, then, the S&P 500’s concentration would be roughly the same whether the index weighted companies by market value or net income, although the order of companies might differ. For instance, the top five stocks weighted by net income would account for 21 percent of the index, compared with 24 percent by market value; the top 50 would account for 57 percent of the index, the same percentage as by market value; and the top 100 by net income would account for 74 percent, modestly more than 71 percent by market value.The reason the S&P 500 is so concentrated is simply that a few companies are making a lot more money than everyone else. In 1990, the first year for which numbers are available, the top five companies in the S&P 500 accounted for 12.3 percent of the index and contributed 12.6 percent of total profits. Today’s top five contribute more than that to total profits, which is also why they occupy more of the index.The S&P 500 would almost certainly be riskier if it didn’t favor more valuable companies. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, which weights S&P 500 companies equally rather than by market value, has been 10 percent more volatile than the traditional S&P 500, as measured by annualized standard deviation since 1990. The equal weight index has also been more volatile than the traditional S&P 500 90 percent of the time over rolling three-year periods, with all the exceptions clustered around the peak and subsequent crash of the dot-com bubble.With renewed frenzy around technology, most recently artificial intelligence, one might conclude that the equal weight index is indeed safer. But the problem with the dot-com era was that stock valuations were stretched beyond reason, not that the market was too concentrated. The top five stocks in the S&P 500 at the peak of dot-com mania in 1999 accounted for about 16 percent of the index, which is not much higher than the historical average.That’s not to say the S&P 500 is risk free. On the contrary, the index is regularly in the path of crises and manias that temporarily shave off a quarter to half of its value. And concentration aside, history shows that some or all of today’s big five are unlikely to remain there in a decade or two. Through it all, however, the S&P 500 has returned about 10% a year over the long term, making it one of the most lucrative investments around.Think of the S&P 500 and other indexes weighted by market value as constantly rejiggering their lineup to balance risk — and be thankful for one less thing investors have to worry about.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering markets. Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.Credit: Bloomberg           Check your money calendar for 2023-24 here and keep your date with your investments, taxes, bills, and all things money.

Industries like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence have the potential to create incredible value. Four stocks in particular could be among the world's most valuable by 2040. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Market Cap $792B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.22%) $5.43 Current Price $249.83 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Long-term investors might want to own a slice of these four powerhouse companies. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest company in the world today with a $2.9 trillion market capitalization. Its stock went public in 1980, and it has since delivered a whopping return of 183,300% for investors. In dollar terms, an investment of $1,000 in Apple stock at its IPO would be worth over $1.8 million today! But it wasn't the first stock to have changed investors' lives over the long term, and it certainly won't be the last. So where will the next generation of market leaders come from? Companies developing electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity could be the best candidates. With that in mind, here are four stocks that fit the bill, and they could soar to become among the world's most valuable by 2040. 1. Tesla EVs are at the core of Tesla's (TSLA 2.22%) business; they account for the overwhelming majority of its revenue, and the company leads the industry in production and sales. It expects to produce 1.8 million cars in 2023, and CEO Elon Musk estimates that number could top 20 million by 2030. But EVs are also at the heart of what could be Tesla's most valuable long-term opportunity: its fully autonomous self-driving software. It is currently in live beta mode and has tested it over 150 million miles of road in the real world, with Elon Musk predicting it could be released publicly this year. By installing the software, a Tesla owner will be able to enroll a car as an autonomous robo-taxi within a ride-hailing network, where it will earn money during the hours it's not required for personal use. An estimate by Cathie Wood's Ark Investment thinks this could be a $4 trillion revenue opportunity by 2027, and it forms the basis of the firm's prediction that Tesla stock could soar almost 10-fold to $2,000 by then. Since competition is ramping up in the EV space, Tesla's leadership position in self-driving software could insulate it from an inevitable slowdown in sales over the long term, which is an attribute few other car companies will be able to match. Tesla is valued at $681 billion today, so if Ark's prediction comes true, the company will easily be one of the most valuable in the world by 2027, let alone 2040. 2. Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity is quickly becoming one of the most crucial industries in the world. A broad range of estimates place the value of the sector's opportunity in the trillions of dollars; one calculation by research firm McKinsey & Company suggests organizations are already underinvested in cybersecurity by about $1.8 trillion. Palo Alto Networks (PANW 4.11%) is the world's most valuable cybersecurity company today with a market capitalization of $70 billion. The company claims to use AI to a greater extent than any of its competitors, and perhaps that's true given that it has the most comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity products. It's working to embed AI into its three core segments: cloud security, network security, and security operations. Palo Alto's AI models already block 8.6 billion attacks on behalf of customers each day, the company says, which is a culmination of the learning achieved by ingesting 750 million data points every 24 hours. According to a survey conducted by global consulting firm PwC, one-quarter of top corporate executives think their businesses will be either highly or extremely vulnerable to cyber risks over the next five years. New advancements in AI could help plug complex vulnerabilities to give those CEOs more confidence, and that alone could usher in a new era of cybersecurity investment. Palo Alto stock just earned a place in the S&P 500 index, which validates its incredible rise to the top of its field over the last few years. Based on the growing need for cybersecurity, spending should easily run into the trillions of dollars by 2040, and this company is well-positioned to remain at the front of the pack. 3. Nvidia Since hitting a 52-week low of $108 just eight months ago, shares of Nvidia (NVDA 1.84%) have surged 262%. The company's dominant leadership position in the artificial intelligence space is at the core of that move, and it's really starting to transform its financial results. Nvidia is a semiconductor company, and it makes the most powerful data-center chips in the industry for training AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It has a whopping 90% market share in that specific segment, and the company recently said there's $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI. That's a seismic opportunity for Nvidia to have almost entirely to itself (for now). In its recent financial report for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended April 30), Nvidia not only crushed Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, but it also issued revised revenue guidance for the second quarter that was $4 billion higher than any prior estimates. But here's the kicker: This wave of AI-driven value creation might just be getting started. Ark Investment Management thinks the technology will create $90 trillion in enterprise value by 2030, and add $200 trillion to global economic output thanks to immense gains in productivity. Nvidia is already the sixth-largest company in the world, and that could be the floor because the sky's the limit when it comes to 2040. 4. Amazon Amazon (AMZN 2.54%) is the undisputed global leader in e-commerce and cloud computing services, but it also has a formidable presence in other industries like robotics, digital advertising, and -- of course -- artificial intelligence. Amazon is worth $1.2 trillion today, which makes it the fifth-largest company in the world, and I'm suggesting it will at least hold that position thanks to its operational diversity. The company generated $220 billion in online sales in 2022, but a peek behind the curtain of that operation reveals an even more exciting opportunity. It has over 520,000 autonomous robots zipping around its fulfillment centers, and thanks to technological advances, they are now 2.5 times more efficient than human workers at picking and packing products. Amazon doesn't sell its robots to third parties yet, but it's worthwhile noting that the industry could be worth $9 trillion by 2030 (according to Ark Invest). Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's cloud segment, and it's the point of focus for investors because it's the primary source of the company's overall profitability. AWS offers a broader portfolio of solutions and generates more revenue than any of its competitors. Plus, it's one of Nvidia's oldest data-center customers, and it's rapidly becoming a key distributor of AI. AWS is set to launch its new EC2 P5 cloud instances, which will enable customers to seamlessly scale from 10,000 GPU chips to 20,000. The supercomputer-like performance will help them train larger language models than ever before, in addition to AI applications in general. I think Amazon has a clear pathway to a $5 trillion valuation over the next 10 years, which should solidify its place as one of the world's largest companies by 2040.

Apple's recently unveiled headset has taken leaps in VR innovation. Meanwhile, AMD has much to gain from supplying its chips to the market. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMD Advanced Micro Devices Market Cap $208B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (3.42%) $4.27 Current Price $129.19 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These companies have massive potential in the quickly growing $17 billion industry. Recent technological advances shed light on virtual reality (VR) in recent months, making it an industry worth keeping a close eye on. Meta Platforms and Sony have dominated the VR space with their respective headsets for years. But despite the stature of these companies, consumer adoption has been slow, with gamers seemingly the only group of shoppers with a strong interest in the technology. Meta has pivoted its business almost completely toward VR development and the metaverse. Yet, the company has had little success there. However, the sector could receive a massive boost now that Apple (AAPL 1.56%) entered the picture with its recently announced VR/AR headset, the Vision Pro. The company's history of success in new markets is immensely promising for the potential of its new headset and could spark a boom in the industry from the competition. Tech companies looking to expand their VR departments will likely turn to chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 3.42%), making it another great stock to keep on your radar. Here's a look at each of these virtual reality stocks. 1. Apple On June 5, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The headset marked the debut of a new product category for the company, something that hasn't happened since the release of the Apple Watch in 2016. The Vision Pro has taken a massive step forward in VR, with features never before seen in competing headsets. The device is a full-fledged computer in a headset casing, granting it all the productivity and entertainment capabilities of a MacBook. Meanwhile, it has removed the need for controllers required in headsets from Sony and Meta by utilizing eye tracking and hand gestures. While Apple has given a glimpse of how VR can be incorporated into one's everyday life, the Vision Pro's starting price of $3,500 makes it challenging to get the headset into the hands of the average consumer. As a result, an investment in Apple is for its long-term potential in the sector. Future iterations of the Vision Pro will likely offer more palatable pricing, a strategy the company followed with past first-generation products. For instance, the base model Apple Watch's launch price started between $349 to $399, depending on size. These figures would equate to $430 and $490 today. Meanwhile, today's lowest-priced model comes in at $249 for the Apple Watch SE. The Vision Pro could see a similar trajectory regarding its pricing and product variations. The VR market is expected to hit a value of $227 billion by 2029, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 45%, according to Fortune Business Insights. Apple's dominance in consumer tech and brand loyalty strengthens its outlook in VR and makes its stock an attractive buy as the industry blossoms. 2. Advanced Micro Devices Apple's Vision Pro has upped the game in VR, using the same chip as the current MacBook Air. Comparatively, Meta's Oculus Quest Pro headset uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 chip, based on the Snapdragon 865 used in premium smartphones in 2020. As a result, Apple has essentially made its headset a full-on computer, while its biggest competitor's equivalent product has the power of a three-year-old smartphone. The discrepancy will likely motivate companies to up their game, as Apple has set a new standard for the industry. Cue Advanced Micro Devices. AMD is a leader in custom chips, powering a number of devices across tech. The company is the exclusive supplier of graphics and processing power in Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S game consoles, which has boosted its gaming segment in recent years. The lucrative partnerships led AMD to provide custom chips to a growing number of handheld PC gaming devices as well, as the company becomes the go-to for such hardware. VR headset makers like Meta will be on the hunt for more powerful chips for the next generation of their devices if they want to compete with Apple, and AMD is well-positioned as the clear choice. The company's chips are capable of running intensive VR and AR workloads, indicating it could significantly profit from the market's development. Moreover, AMD's price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.2 strengthens the argument for its stock. The figure suggests that projected growth is not priced into its shares, making it a bargain compared to its potential. And with that, AMD stock is an excellent option to invest in the swiftly growing VR market.

Apple has a history of disrupting early movers with superior products. Unity Software provides the picks and shovels for the growing metaverse market. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: META Meta Platforms Market Cap $695B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.30%) $6.10 Current Price $271.05 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Meta Systems, Apple, and Unity Software could all be great long-term plays in this growing market. As the PC and mobile markets mature, many growth-oriented investors are looking toward the metaverse as the next big computing platform. The term -- and the concept behind it -- came from Neal Stephenson's 1992 sci-fi bestseller Snow Crash, but it only gained more mainstream attention over the past few years as more advanced virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets hit the market. The bulls believe the metaverse will eventually blur the lines between the physical and digital worlds by enhancing real-world environments with digital overlays, virtually transporting people to both imaginary places and digital twins of real-world locations, and enabling people to remotely interact with each other without PCs or smartphones. It could also revolutionize video games by replacing monitors, TVs, consoles, and controllers with mixed-reality headsets. Image source: Apple. According to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the metaverse market could grow from $61.8 billion in 2022 to $426.9 billion by 2027 -- a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.2%. We should take that bullish forecast with a grain of salt, but these three tech giants -- Meta Platforms (META 2.30%), Apple (AAPL 1.56%), and Unity Software (U -0.85%) -- could profit from the market's secular expansion. Let's see what makes these three stocks potential buys this month. 1. Meta Platforms In October 2021, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta Platforms to emphasize its plan to evolve from a social media company into a metaverse one. It wants to achieve that transformation by expanding its Reality Labs division, which houses its VR and AR hardware and software, regardless of the near-term costs. Meta recently said that it sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets over the past four years. But from 2019 to 2022, the Reality Labs unit only generated $6.07 billion in cumulative revenues over those four years while racking up a cumulative operating loss of $35.03 billion. Meta expects the segment's annual operating losses to widen again this year as it launches its new Quest 3 headset this fall and ramps up its production of new AR and VR content. Those losses are staggering, but Meta remains firmly profitable because its core advertising business (which accounted for 97% of its revenue in 2022) still operates at high margins. That business is also gradually recovering from the user privacy improvements that Apple made to iOS (which disrupted platforms' ability to target ads to people) while countering TikTok's short videos with its own similar Reels. Meta still enjoys an early-mover advantage in the metaverse market, and the Quest 3's $499 price tag might make it the best option for consumers who don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a VR headset. That could also help tether more of the 3.81 billion people who use at least one of Meta's core apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) each month to its metaverse ecosystem. 2. Apple After years of rumors and speculation, Apple finally unveiled its new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset during its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. The Vision Pro is more technologically advanced than Meta's Quest 3, but it's priced accordingly at $3,499. It's scheduled to hit the market in early 2024 and will only initially be sold in the United States. The Vision Pro's high price tag could limit its appeal, but it could gradually diversify the tech giant's top line away from the iPhone -- which still accounted for 54% of its revenue in its latest quarter. It would also enable Apple to expand its subscription-based Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, and Apple Fitness+ services with AR and VR upgrades. Apple ended its latest quarter with 975 million paid subscriptions across that ecosystem, which represented 18% growth from a year earlier. By pulling some of those subscribers toward the Vision Pro and its mixed-reality apps, Apple could further strengthen the bonds between its hardware, software, and subscription-based services. It's well worth remembering that Apple didn't invent the MP3 player, the smartphone, the tablet computer, the smartwatch, or Bluetooth earbuds. But it disrupted all of those markets by studying the mistakes of the early movers, developing more appealing products, and tethering its devices to the rest of its prisoner-taking ecosystem. If the Vision Pro follows that same trajectory, it could eventually add tens of billions of dollars to Apple's annual revenue. 3. Unity Software Last but not least, Unity is my top pick-and-shovel play on the metaverse market. Its namesake game development engine already powers more than half of the world's mobile, PC, and console games, and many of the most popular VR games -- including Meta's Beat Saber and Population: One -- were created on its platform. That's why it wasn't surprising when Apple recently said it was working with Unity to create new apps for the Vision Pro. Unity's growth decelerated last year after Apple's privacy-oriented iOS update disrupted its ability to target the ads for its games. However, it bounced back from that setback by rewriting its own algorithms and merging with adtech company ironSource. As a result, it expects the growth of both its Grow (advertising and monetization) and Create (game development engine and non-gaming tools) units to accelerate again this year. Unity is certainly a more speculative play than Meta or Apple, but its revenue could surge as sales of new headsets drive more developers to create more metaverse apps.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Is It Too Late to Buy Unity Software Stock? By Leo Sun – Jun 8, 2023 at 5:58AM Key Points Unity's Q1 earnings report brought back the bulls. Its mixed-reality partnership with Apple amplified those gains. Its stock looks cheap relative to its expectations for 2024. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: U Unity Software Market Cap $14B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.85%) -$0.31 Current Price $35.99 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The video game engine developer is overcoming its near-term challenges. Unity Software's (U -0.85%) stock price rallied about 35% over the past month on two positive developments. First, the video game engine developer posted better-than-expected first-quarter results on May 10 and raised its full-year guidance. Second, Apple (AAPL 1.56%) said it was working with Unity to develop mixed-reality apps for its new Vision Pro headset during its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5. Those two developments brought some bulls back to Unity, but its stock remains 30% below its initial public offering price and more than 80% below its all-time high. Is it the right time to buy Unity as a turnaround play, or is it too late to hop on the bandwagon? Image source: Apple. Why did the bulls initially abandon Unity? Unity's game development engine is used to create more than half of the world's mobile, console, and PC games. It simplifies the entire process by bundling tools for creating graphics, sound effects, and other assets on a single platform. It also helps developers monetize their games with ads and in-game purchases. Unity initially impressed the bulls with its dazzling growth rates. Its revenue rose 43% in 2020, climbed 44% in 2021, and management claimed the company could maintain an annual growth rate of 30% over the ""long term."" But in 2022, its revenue only grew 25%. Unity's growth cooled off for two reasons. First, the video game market faced tough year-over-year comparisons against its pandemic-induced growth spurt throughout 2020 and 2021. Second, Apple's privacy changes on iOS disrupted Unity Ads' ability to craft targeted ads from third-party data. That disruption forced Unity to reboot its entire advertising business by rewriting its algorithms and merging with the adtech company ironSource last November. At its all-time high, Unity's enterprise value reached $56 billion, or 40 times the revenue it would generate in 2022. That bubbly valuation, along with its slowing sales growth and lack of profits, set it up for a steep drop when interest rates started rising last year. Will the latest news bring back the bulls? On a pro forma basis (including its merger with ironSource), Unity management expects revenue to rise 3% to 9% in 2023. It expects the company's top-line growth to stabilize this year as it reboots Unity Ads, benefits from China's recovery from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and gradually raises the prices for its paid tiers. It also expects its expansion into adjacent markets -- including digital twins and theatrical special effects (through its Weta Digital subsidiary) to bring in more revenue. Apple's new Vision Pro partnership with Unity could complement those plans. That deal isn't surprising, since its engine was already used to develop games for Meta Platforms' Quest headsets. But Apple might sell more headsets than Meta, which already sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets over the past four years, and drive more developers to use Unity to create mixed-reality apps. That growth could further diversify Unity's business away from mobile, console, and PC games. But with a hefty price tag of $3,499, Apple's Vision Pro could get off to a slow start when it launches in the U.S. in early 2024. Meta's new Quest 3 headset will only cost $499 when it arrives this fall. Therefore, investors who expect Apple's Vision Pro to boost Unity's near-term revenue will likely be disappointed. Investors should also recall that Unity operates a freemium platform, which tends to attract a lot of ""shovelware"" developers -- who ""shovel out"" low-quality apps without contributing any revenue. A lot of those shovelware developers could initially flock to the Vision Pro when it finally arrives. Will Unity's stock continue to rise? Unity currently has an enterprise value of $15 billion, or 7 times its projected revenue for 2023. That valuation is a bit high for a company that expects its revenue to only grow by the mid-single digits (on a pro forma basis) this year. But after lapping its merger with ironSource, analysts expect Unity's revenue to rise 19% in 2024 and 18% in 2025. Investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they suggest it can overcome its near-term advertising issues and benefit from the long-term growth of the gaming, mixed-reality, digital twin, and theatrical effects markets. Unity also expects to generate $250 million to $300 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) this year as it aggressively reins in its spending. That would mark its first positive annual adjusted EBITDA as a public company. It also believes it can generate a $1 billion adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of 2024. Based on those longer-term estimates, Unity still seems reasonably valued at 6 times its 2024 revenue and 15 times its adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, if you believe Unity's business will continue to stabilize and expand, then it's not too late to buy its stock. Unity's insiders have also bought nearly 5 times as many shares as they sold over the past 12 months -- so brighter days might be ahead for this software company.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Wall Street Thinks This Stock Could Make Warren Buffett the Most Money Over the Next 12 Months By Keith Speights – Jun 8, 2023 at 5:52AM Key Points Some top contenders can be ruled out. One stock could make Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway close to $8 billion over the next 12 months if analysts are right. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: BAC Bank of America Market Cap $232B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.48%) -$0.14 Current Price $29.13 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Analysts are especially bullish about this Buffett stock. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.36%) (BRK.B -0.50%) owns shares of nearly 50 stocks, but Warren Buffett didn't personally pick all of them. A few positions were initiated by Berkshire's investment managers. However, Buffett could profit from any of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio. Some are likely to be much bigger winners than others. Wall Street thinks this stock could make Buffett the most money over the next 12 months. Ruling out some top contenders Before we get to that potential biggest moneymaker, let's rule out some of the top contenders. Analysts don't believe that several of the stocks many might guess would generate the biggest gains for Buffett will move the needle enough. For example, Apple (AAPL 1.56%) ranks as Berkshire's biggest single holding, by far. It wouldn't be surprising, therefore, if it made Buffett the most money over any given period. However, the consensus price target for Apple stock reflects an upside potential of less than 3%. Even the highly anticipated announcement of Apple's mixed-reality headset hasn't excited analysts enough to affect their price targets. What about Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.22%)? Buffett is buying the oil stock more aggressively these days than any other. Berkshire now owns nearly 25% of Oxy. Wall Street is certainly bullish about Occidental. The average analyst's 12-month price target is roughly 17% above the current share price. But while an increase of that much would make Berkshire more than $2 billion in gains, Occidental still isn't the stock Wall Street has in mind. Take it to the bank I won't prolong the suspense. The one stock that Wall Street thinks will make Buffett the most money over the next 12 months is... Bank of America (BAC -0.48%). The consensus price target for Bank of America, Berkshire's second-largest position, reflects an upside potential of around 23%. With Berkshire's stake in BofA currently worth over $30 billion, a 23% increase would make the company nearly $7 billion. This amount, by the way, doesn't include any dividend income Berkshire should make with the bank stock. Bank of America currently pays an annualized dividend of $0.88 per share. Since it owns over 1.03 million shares, it stands to receive nearly $910 million in dividends over the next 12 months. Why are analysts so upbeat about Bank of America? One big reason is the stock is dirt cheap right now. After being hammered by the banking crisis earlier this year, BofA shares trade at a forward earnings multiple of below 8.4. But the bank's financial position remains strong. Its management team is top-notch and the company stands out as one of the leading technological innovators in the banking sector. Wall Street knows all of this. They realize that BofA's decline should only be a temporary one. Beyond 12 months Which stock is likely to make Buffett the most money over a longer period than 12 months -- say five to 10 years? Analysts won't help us with that question. However, I have a pretty good guess -- and I don't think it's Bank of America. I recently predicted that Amazon and Occidental will be Buffett's biggest winners this decade. Neither will be his biggest moneymaker, though. That honor will go to Apple, in my view. Berkshire's massive stake in Apple means that the stock doesn't have to move very much to generate a lot of money for the conglomerate. I'm optimistic about Apple's long-term growth prospects. Barring some dramatic change in Berkshire's stake in the company, I expect that Apple will easily be Buffett's biggest moneymaker over the next five to 10 years. But I agree with Wall Street about Bank of America. It probably will make the Oracle of Omaha the most money over the shorter term. And it could make investors who aren't multibillionaires money, as well. John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

There will likely continue to be a buzz around this long-awaited device as the months pass before it's available to consumers. For investors, the impact may be even further away. The level to which this device becomes a revenue driver for the company is uncertain. Apple certainly has a track record of successful hardware launches, but there's no guarantee that will continue. Additionally, with a price tag of $3,499, it's likely that initial adoption will be slow. The important thing to watch for investors is how this device ultimately drives customers deeper into Apple's ecosystem of subscriptions as this is the highest-margin source of revenue for Apple. This segment accounts for 22% of total revenue, which is up from 19% three years ago. While Apple shareholders wait to see how successful this new product will be, they continue to benefit from the company's shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. Over the past 10 years, Apple has raised its dividend by 120% and lowered its shares outstanding by 38%. This makes Apple a compelling investment with or without a new hardware device. Costco As the third-largest retailer in the world, Costco Wholesale (COST 0.71%) is familiar to most consumers even if they're not members. It's also been a market-crushing investment over almost any time frame. Over the past 10 years, Costco's total return has been 477%, compared to the S&P 500's 222%. Over that same time frame, Costco has increased its dividend by 229%. In fact, since Costco first initiated its dividend in 2004, it has increased at a compound annual rate of 13%. There are many reasons for Costco's long-term success, but one unique aspect of its business model is its membership fees. Over the trailing 12 months, Costco has collected $4.4 billion in membership fees. While this accounts for less than 2% of total revenue, it's the catalyst that gets shoppers into the stores. At the end of the most recently reported quarter, the fiscal third quarter of 2023, Costco had 69,100 members and 124,700 cardholders. These metrics each grew by 7% compared to Q3 2022. Costco has faced some challenges recently but zoom out and the results are impressive. Consider Costco's revenue and net income over the very long term. COST Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts An important factor to consider when looking at this chart is that Costco succeeds even through recessions (the gray bars on the chart), showing the power of its value proposition to its members. This is worth considering if there is a recession in the coming months. Starbucks Starbucks (SBUX 0.51%) is another company with an impressive track record of market-beating performance and an increasing dividend. Over the past 10 years, it has outpaced the market's performance by nearly 62% and increased its dividend by 404%. Starbucks is a compelling stock to buy right now because the company is finally seeing a turnaround in its international business, which has struggled since the pandemic lockdowns, especially in China. In the second quarter of 2023, which ended in April, Starbucks' international revenue increased 9% year over year, driven by China's recovery. This is extremely important to Starbucks as China is the company's second-largest market after the U.S. The challenges Starbucks has faced in China over the last few years have dragged the stock price down. While it has recovered nicely in 2023, the current valuation is still on the inexpensive side relative to the historical average. Starbucks trades for 3.4 times sales, which is below the 10-year average of 4. The same is true for price-to-earnings ratio, which is currently 32, below the average of 68. There are brighter days ahead for Starbucks internationally, but the current price appears to still be carrying some of the residual effects of the last few years' challenges. This presents an opportunity for investors who are looking for a growth company that also has a growing dividend. Jeff Santoro has positions in Apple, Costco Wholesale, and Starbucks.

Two tech stocks, with very different growth trajectories, were aggressively bought by successful money managers in the March-ended quarter. Meanwhile, a perennial outperformer was put on the chopping block by multiple billionaire fund managers. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: INTC Intel Market Cap $138B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (5.52%) $1.73 Current Price $33.07 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Brand-name tech stocks were popular buys (and sells) among billionaire money managers during the first quarter. In case you haven't noticed, data releases are occurring all the time on Wall Street. From earnings reports to economic data, it's easy for investors to be overwhelmed and miss something important. A little over three weeks ago, there's a decent chance you missed one of those important announcements. May 15 marked deadline for institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful fund managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter (in this instance, the March-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images. As should come as no surprise, tech stocks were very much in focus -- especially among billionaire investors. Based on 13Fs, Wall Street billionaires piled into two large-cap tech stocks and avoided another widely held tech innovator like the plague during the first quarter. Large-cap tech stock No. 1 billionaire investors piled into: Intel The first big-name tech stock that Wall Street billionaires couldn't stop buying in the March-ended quarter is underperforming semiconductor company Intel (INTC 5.52%). All told, five billionaires were avid buyers, including: Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management Israel Englander of Millennium Management Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International Keeping this same order intact, these billionaires respectively purchased approximately 13.13 million shares, 10.4 million shares, 7.69 million shares, 1.99 million shares, and 1.2 million shares of Intel stock. What makes these purchases so intriguing is that they occurred during Intel's worst quarter in its storied history. The company lost $2.76 billion and saw revenue for its core client computing group and data center and AI (artificial intelligence) segments fall by 38% and 39%, respectively, from the prior-year period.  Normally, such poor performance would chase prospective investors away. However, there looks to be genuine value here for those willing to be patient. For example, Intel is currently spending $20 billion to construct two chip fabrication plants in Ohio, which are slated to open sometime next year.  It's also in the process of acquiring Tower Semiconductor. When all of these actions are complete, Intel will be on track to potentially become the second-largest foundry service provider by 2030. Providing domestic businesses with an alternative to overseas chip fab should help Intel regain some of its luster. Something else to consider is that Intel's market share losses to chief rival Advanced Micro Devices aren't game-changing. Intel still controls the lion's share of central processing unit sales in personal computers and data centers. That's not going to change anytime soon, which is good news for Intel's top cash-flow-generating segments. Furthermore, Intel has a beast on its hands with autonomous driving solutions company Mobileye Global (MBLY -4.48%). Intel acquired Mobileye six years ago for a little north of $15 billion.  When it was spun-out in 2022, Intel retained a majority of the outstanding shares. Mobileye closed this past week with a market cap of nearly $35 billion and the company's sales are rapidly rising. Large-cap tech stock No. 2 billionaire investors piled into: Palo Alto Networks A second large-cap tech stock that select Wall Street billionaires absolutely piled into during the first quarter is cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (PANW 4.11%). Form 13Fs show there were three big buyers: Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management Ken Griffin at Citadel Advisors Chase Coleman at Tiger Global Management During the first quarter, Cohen, Griffin, and Coleman oversaw the respective purchase of roughly 571,400 shares, 355,100 shares, and 257,700 shares of Palo Alto Networks' stock. Unlike the buying activity with Intel, which doesn't make sense unless you do some digging, it's crystal clear why billionaires are lapping up shares of Palo Alto. Next-generation security annual recurring revenue surged 60% in the latest quarter from the prior-year period, with total remaining performance obligations (i.e., the company's backlog) rising 35% to $9.2 billion.  In short, the company is firing on all cylinders. Ever since management made the decision nearly five years ago to shift the company's focus to cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions, Palo Alto has been virtually unstoppable. These higher-margin subscriptions now account for about 79% of net sales.  More importantly, SaaS is helping to court larger customers that are more willing to add to their initial purchase. Add-on sales with its next-gen solutions are critical to boosting the company's subscription gross margin. As I've stated in the past, Palo Alto Networks has also done a phenomenal job of incorporating inorganic growth into the mix. Bolt-on acquisitions have given the company a means to expand its product offerings and appeal to a broader swath of businesses. Lastly, cybersecurity can be considered a basic necessity service. Even though tech stocks tend to be cyclical, businesses are migrating their data online and into the cloud at a faster pace than ever before. Since hackers don't take time off from trying to steal sensitive information, the need for cybersecurity solutions tends to be a constant in any economic environment. Image source: Getty Images. The large-cap tech stock billionaires wanted nothing to do with: Apple However, it wasn't only buying on billionaires' minds during the first quarter. America's largest public company by market cap, Apple (AAPL 1.56%), was given the heave-ho by a number of successful fund managers, including: Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors Israel Englander of Millennium Management Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International In the order listed above, these five billionaires respectively dumped 7.52 million shares, 7.09 million shares, 5.12 million shares, 2.22 million shares, and 1.1 million shares of Apple stock. If you're wondering why billionaires are avoiding Apple like the plague, it may have to do with the company's valuation. Between the start of 2013 and end of 2018, you could nab shares of Apple for 10 to 15 times earnings. Best of all, it was consistently growing by a low double-digit rate. Today, you'll be paying about 30 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for Apple in fiscal 2023 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September). While some investors might argue that a multiple of 30 isn't egregious for an industry leader like Apple, consider that its sales are expected to decline by nearly 3% in fiscal 2023, even with historically high inflation as a tailwind. Further, rapidly rising interest rates have removed access to cheap capital, which has the potential to slow Apple's pace of stock buybacks. The other possible knock with Apple is that it simply didn't do enough with iPhone 14 to differentiate it from previous 5G-capable models. Make no mistake, sales of the iPhone still dominate the U.S. smartphone market. However, there had been talk about expanding iPhone production in September of last year, which ultimately fell through after iPhone 14's relatively subdued launch. On the other hand, Apple is still a cash cow. It generated almost $110 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period, and has repurchased a jaw-dropping $586 billion worth of its common stock over the past 10 years. As a long-term business, Apple is rock-solid. But from an investment standpoint right now, it's difficult to justify its current valuation, especially with sales and profits contracting.

Got it!Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinThe technology sector has been outperforming the averages for several months now. A breather is overdue. But that could be just the chance for investors to get on board! Here are three picks from three different MoneyShow contributors for this thriving, tech-driven market. Paul Dykewicz, StockInvestor.com Our team has identified five cutting-edge software investments to buy as technology rises again. The list features three funds, a cybersecurity company, and another primed to grow from artificial intelligence and automation. First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV TDIV ) is one of the diversified names. We’re showcasing investments that have been climbing as technology stocks recover from a plunge of more than 30% in 2022. Investors who don’t mind volatility may be able to outperform the market by taking the ups and downs of technology stock investing in stride to pursuit potentially strong returns in 2023. A broader-based tech fund with a higher dividend yield is TDIV. The ETF tries to track the Nasdaq Technology Dividend Index, which is composed of technology and telecommunications companies.TDIV Tickerstockcharts.com The fund recently had 94 holdings, and its 10 largest positions accounted for 59% of its assets. The biggest weightings were Microsoft MSFT (MSFT), Apple AAPL (AAPL), Intel INTC (INTC), Broadcom AVGO (AGVO VO ) and IBM (IBM IBM ). Roughly 13% of the fund was in communication services and the rest fit into the technology sector. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor Recommended Action: Buy TDIV Hilary Kramer, GameChangers We rarely get much of a chance to talk about it, but momentum in the market works like physics. Any stock in motion will continue moving along that trajectory until some outside force gets in its way. Palantir Technologies PLTR (PLTR) is a name that has shot into the scoring zone. Most of our stocks reported good enough operational performance in the last few works to start moving toward the upside . . . some faster than others, but generally the right direction. Positions we were holding before they reported their quarterly numbers have rallied an average of 14.3% since. That’s pretty good. When you consider that the S&P 500 is down a fraction since the start of earnings season, it’s exceptional. What we’re left with is a generally warm vibe. A lot of people on Wall Street underestimated these companies. Estimates were too low, which means that now price targets need to rise in order to make the models match reality. After all, while everyone is entitled to an opinion on where the numbers are going, the magic of earnings season means that once the quarterly report comes out, there’s no more debate on how the numbers have stacked up. And once you accumulate enough data points pointing in one direction (UP), it gets really hard to argue that they “should be” going the other way. Most of our data points have pointed up this season, forcing stubborn investors and analysts to concede that they were wrong and that these companies are worth buying at this price. The machine-learning software and data-mining specialist PLTR in particular has been a revelation. Palantir Technologies (PLTR)PLTR chartquotemedia That stock had been left for dead before earnings proved that last quarter’s promises were more than a mirage. On the eve of its quarterly report, it had relapsed to $7.74. Here we are now, back above $12 and even $13.50 where the action gets especially intense. There’s absolutely nothing stopping PLTR from continuing to do well. I’d be inclined to see how far it can reach back toward what’s now the 2022 ceiling. Remember, we weren’t in the grip of zero-rate Fed mania then. That was close to the depth of bear market misery. And even then, PLTR managed to trade close to $15 before starting its long dreadful slide. That’s the kind of scenario I want to reach toward as the bull recovers. And it means that PLTR is a gift at this price. Recommended Action: Buy PLTR. George Gilder, Gilder’s Moonshots SkyWater Technology (SKYT) specializes in helping its customers develop and then manufacture customized integrated circuit devices. Setting the company apart is a trifecta of differentiation. For starters, it’s the only US-based and solely US-owned pure-play semiconductor foundry. Then there is SkyWater’s portfolio of specialized wafer fabrication processes including mixed-signal CMOS, rad-hard ICs, power discretes, MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), superconducting ICs, photonics, carbon nanotubes, and others. Finally, the company’s novel customer engagement model, dubbed Technology as a Service (TaaS), enables innovative chip firms to co-create novel solutions across SkyWater’s technologies, diverse manufacturing capabilities, and design/production services. One innovator taking advantage of SkyWater’s Technology as a Service model is Weebit Nano. If that name sounds familiar, until a few months ago we held WBT WBT in the Special Situations Portfolio of the Gilder Technology Report. We got great results: The stock more than doubled in less than a year, meeting its total return target before we closed the position. You have not heard the last of Weebit, which makes an emergent form of nonvolatile memory called ReRAM (resistive random-access memory) that is enabling new applications from neuromorphic computing to industrial IoT. Weebit is one of more than a dozen breakthrough startup companies spun out of James Tour’s lab at Rice University. Yes, that’s another familiar name as we’ve written a great deal about Tour’s pioneering work in nanotechnology and graphene. Most of the Tour spinoffs are still privately held. One of the few publicly traded Tour spinoffs, WBT is on the Australian Stock Exchange. On the verge of generating revenue after years of R&D with the help of SkyWater, the company recently raised A$60 million of equity to continue development of its ReRAM technology. SkyWater’s engagement with ReRAM started with a collaboration on a carbon nanotube-based 3D project with MIT, funded through DARPA’s Electronics Resurgence Initiative. That work built the core competences underlying SkyWater’s development partnership with Weebit. ReRAM offers strategic advantages over currently dominant Flash memory including improved write time, endurance, cost-effectiveness, and power consumption. (See exhibit below.) It may seem counterintuitive that these specialized memory devices can undercut Flash on costs. This is thanks in part to the fact that ReRAM fabrication is highly complementary to SkyWater’s foundational CMOS platform. The fabrication of NAND Flash is a far more complex process.Weebit ChartWeebit Nano SKYT is one of the most exciting opportunities in the Moonshots portfolio.

Do you feel lucky?

Great balance sheets. So what if they lead the way? I mean, a win’s a win.” Cramer is so bullish on these stocks that Matt Tuttle, who runs a mutual fund that bets on Cramer’s picks, tells me that after Thursday’s program he decided to move 50% of the fund’s entire holdings into those seven stocks. And meanwhile Tuttle is moving 50% of another fund, which bets against Cramer’s picks, into “short” positions on the same seven stocks, meaning he is betting that they will go down. So far, so inside baseball. But here’s what most of the public don’t realize. Those seven stocks have now soared so high that they currently make up a staggering 27% of the entire S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% by market value. And that means they now make up 16% of a standard U.S. retirement portfolio, which is typically invested 60% in the S&P 500 and 40% U.S. bonds. If you own any kind of standard, benchmark or plain-vanilla retirement fund you are almost certainly heavily invested in seven sky-high stocks that Cramer loves. On average, you’re likely to have $1 of every $6 in them. Yikes! Or should I say, “booyah”? Is this a problem? As usual, it depends on who you ask. Many on Wall Street, and in the financial planning industry, will swear blind that the market is perfectly “efficient,” meaning share prices always make sense. Therefore, they argue, if these seven companies account for one-sixth of a balanced 60/40 portfolio then that’s perfectly sensible. Others will say that’s total rubbish. The question of Cramer is a thorny one. Cramer’s critics say he is often a reverse indicator, turning most bullish on a trend right at the peak and most bearish right at the bottom. The “curse of Cramer” is a running joke on Twitter. If he is now all-in on the booming Magnificent Seven, critics say, it’s time to start eyeing the exit. This is the rationale behind Tuttle’s Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF ( SJIM, -2.99% ). I asked CNBC if they, or Cramer, wanted to comment. They declined. But let me offer some defense. I actually like Cramer (despite, or maybe because, he once called me an idiot on NBC, in conversation with…Matt Lauer). I once worked for him at TheStreet, and had a fabulous time under the late, great editor Dave Morrow. Cramer gets a lot of criticism. But the problem isn’t that he does his job badly — it’s that he tries to do a job that is completely impossible. Every night he is picking stocks, offering fresh insight, and responding to an insane blizzard of viewers’ calls about their portfolio holdings. Nobody could do his job and beat the market. Nobody. Not Buffett. Not Renaissance’s Capital’s Jim Simons. Not the late Sir John Templeton. It’s amazing Cramer can do it at all. Dave Morrow, the late editor of TheStreet.com, once told me he couldn’t bear to watch more than about 10 minutes of the program at a time. Tuttle, who says he has been watching the program every night all year in order to monitor his funds’ portfolios, jokes: “I am doing long-term damage to my brain.”  The issue is that in the end Cramer becomes — unwittingly or not — a very powerful indicator of the “conventional wisdom” on Wall Street. It’s inevitable.  (It is noteworthy that when Cramer finally felt so despairing of the stock market that he went on The Daily Show and let himself be berated by Jon Stewart, it was early March, 2009—the exact bottom of the crash.) “Basically it’s a short-term momentum strategy, sometimes what’s strong continues to be strong for a while,” says Tuttle of Cramer’s stock picks, adding: “To his credit he has been on NVDA, META, AAPL all year.” And let the record show that since the launch in March, the fund that bets on Jim Cramer has done better than the fund that bets against him: The Long Cramer Tracker LJIM, +2.92% is up 3.2%, while Inverse Cramer is down 3.6%. But even putting Cramer’s bullishness aside, betting 16% of your retirement on seven companies makes no sense. It flouts basic common sense about diversification, if nothing else. It makes even less sense when those companies’ stocks are already expensive, and popular, and being chased to new highs by the hot money. Some numbers may put this in context. According to FactSet data, those seven companies in total are now valued at more than $10 trillion. Their stock market value is now more than twice the annual GDP of Japan. They have gained $3.6 trillion so far this year — which accounts for 85% of all the rise in the entire U.S. stock market, and more than half the total rise in the entire global stock market. They are valued, collectively, at about six times the next year’s expected revenues.  They now trade on an average of 30 times forecast per-share earnings of the next 12 months. That’s about twice the historic stock market average. These seven stocks also account for 23% of the total U.S. stock market by value, when you add in all the midsize and small companies as well as the S&P 500. And a slightly more sane 10% of the total global stock market. Make of this what you will. My own take is that at the bare minimum this insanity pretty much proves the case for holding a global stock portfolio, not merely one invested in the U.S. The truly basic, plain-vanilla 60/40 portfolio should be 60% in a global stock fund like Vanguard Total World Stock VT, +0.67%, not in the S&P 500 or even the total U.S. market. (Actually, I’d go even further in investing in non-U. S. stocks, but that’s another story.) As for the battle between the ETF that bets on Cramer and the ETF that bets against him? Stay tuned.

Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement AAPL +0.13% Soccer legend and newly minted World Cup champion Lionel Messi is set to join U.S. Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami CF next season, according to reports from the BBC’s Guillem Balague and soccer news-breaker Fabrizio Romano. The move for the Argentinian comes after months of speculation of which club he will play for after his eventual departure from France’s Paris Saint-Germain. Other teams reportedly interested in Messi were Barcelona FC and Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal. “If it had been a matter of money, I’d have gone to Arabia or elsewhere. It seemed like a lot of money to me”, Messi said in a Tuesday interview.  “The truth is that my final decision goes elsewhere and not because of money.” See also: LIV and PGA Tour merger: Phil Mickelson and Donald Trump are all ‘fore’ it Inter Miami is the 11th most valuable MLS club at $600 million, per Forbes, and is majority owned by Jorge Mas and soccer legend David Beckham is a co-owner. According to a report from The Athletic, Apple AAPL, +0.13%, which owns the global streaming rights to MLS games, has gotten “very creative” with discussions about a potential Messi move to the MLS. Apple has discussed offering Messi a share of the revenue generated from new subscribers to MLS Season Pass, the tech giant’s Apple TV+ product to watch games, according to sources briefed on the discussions. Apple also announced Tuesday that it is producing a documentary on Messi and his World Cup career that will debut on Apple TV+. That same Athletic report indicated that Adidas, who also sponsors Messi in addition to the MLS, has considered a similar revenue sharing agreement with the soccer star if he came to the MLS. Apple and Adidas did not respond to MarketWatch’s requests for comment on this story. It would be a major boost for American soccer, which has attracted superstars like Pele, Beckham and Thierry Henry over the years.  While the MLS is not considered a top soccer league in the world, trailing other historic entities including England’s Premier League, Germany’s Bundesliga, Spain’s La Liga, and Italy’s Serie A,  the MLS, founded in 1993, is one of the newer soccer leagues in the world. If the reports are accurate, Messi, would have turned down an offer from Al-Hilal that would have paid him roughly $428 million per season, the highest per season contract in the history of professional sports. Other top footballer Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Saudi club Al-Nassr this season for history-making $210 million per season. Messi is a seven-time Ballon d’Or winner, four-time Champions League winner, and 12-time domestic league champion and considered by many to be one of the greatest footballers of all time. Messi, 35, has a net worth in the hundreds of millions. Last year alone he made $130 million ($65 million in salary, $65 million in endorsements), according to Forbes estimates.

Network  June 7, 2023 11:42 AM |  8 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Wednesday market open) Stocks continue treading water near recent nine-month highs ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. It’s a quiet period with little economic data or earnings to propel things in any given direction.Major indexes recently bumped against areas of technical resistance on the charts and don’t seem in a big hurry to mount a test of those levels.The “easy” part of the long 2023 rally might be coming to an end. Until now, investors could almost count on a handful of heavyweight tech stocks driving up the value of major indexes.While there’s a chance that could continue, the dramatic gap between 30% year-to-date gains for the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 (NDX) and 11% gains for the S&P 500® Index suggests other sectors need to step up for the rally to achieve more street cred. The SPX wouldn’t be up at all this year if it weren’t for that same handful of tech stocks.The broader market appears to at least be stirring, with the critical financials sector up over the last week and the last month. Other cyclical sectors like energy, industrials, and materials that sat on the sidelines the last three months also flexed some muscle recently, though energy continues being dragged by a lackluster crude oil market. Consumer discretionary leads all sectors over the last five days and sits behind only info tech and communication services over the last month.Major U.S. indexes finished mostly higher Tuesday as small-cap stocks started to recoup some of the losses they suffered during the banking-sector turmoil back in March. The small-company-focused Russell 2000® (RUT) rose roughly 2.7% to a three-month high.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) was flat at 3.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) inched down to 103.89. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures climbed just slightly to 14.06 and remain near three-year lows. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) rose to $72.47 per barrel. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield had a volatile May, covering more than 50 basis points between its low near 3.3% and its high above 3.8%. The late May yield rally ultimately fizzled, though yesterday’s closing yield of 3.68% remained above the 200-day moving average of 3.63%. The moving average happens to sit near an interesting area on the chart at around 3.6% that’s served as support and resistance for months and bears continued monitoring for possible direction.Volatility remains extremely low at present, but Cboe futures for the coming months build in rising levels.Just inTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview with CNBC this morning that bringing down inflation remains the top priority, but acknowledged potential issues within commercial real estate markets. She also sees a path to bringing down inflation while maintaining a strong labor market.Yellen added that the level of capital and liquidity in the banking system remains strong.What to WatchPerhaps you’ve noticed a lack of major layoff announcements lately after a flurry earlier this year from the tech sector. Though a few companies discussed job cuts during earnings season, job openings continue to grow and unemployment remains historically low under 4%. While no one wants people to lose jobs, this tight labor market could be one reason inflation remains a nagging issue, and tomorrow’s weekly initial jobless claims loom.Analysts expect claims of 237,000, up from 232,000 last week and near the higher end of the recent range. Claims are up this spring from historic lows below 200,000 earlier this year, but they aren’t near levels that suggest recession. The weekly tally would need to reach 300,000 to paint a truly bearish picture for the roaring labor market.Talking technicals: The 4,300 level remains a potential technical resistance spot for the SPX, and above that there’s believed to be technical resistance at last summer’s 4,325 high. Yesterday’s SPX close of 4,283 was the highest this year and since last August, but the info tech stocks that that got the SPX here aren’t sizzling like they did in late May.Stocks in the Spotlight(Almost) halfway home: It’s hard to fathom, but the year is nearly half over. Itching to know what the second half might hold for investors and the global markets? Schwab Chief Global Investment Strategist Jeffrey Kleintop thinks the coming six months may feature less drama but possibly milder returns for global stocks after their double-digit first-half gains. And a mild recession in corporate earnings could continue, he adds.Shares of crypto exchange platform company Coinbase (COIN) rebounded 4% in premarket trading a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged it with operating its platform as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. There’s an elevated amount of uncertainty in this space that could lead to more volatility in an already rocky area of the market.Eye on the FedChances of an interest rate pause at the June meeting stand at 77% this morning, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which also prices in a nearly 66% chance that rates will rise by July. These numbers haven’t moved much the last few days, reinforcing ideas that a pause is likely next week.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starts next Tuesday, the very day of the critical May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. A Fed decision will be announced next Wednesday afternoon.With the meeting ahead and no major data on this week’s calendar, Treasury yields could trade in rangebound territory the next few days, says Collin Martin, director of fixed income strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. CHART OF THE DAY: RUT BREAKS OUT. The Russell 2000 small-cap index (RUT—candlesticks) broke out of a long rut this week, posting three-month highs. It got a lot of help from a reviving banking sector (KRX—purple line), as the RUT is heavily exposed to financials. Data sources: Nasdaq, FTSE Russell. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investExiting penalty box? As the so-called Magnificent Seven big-tech stocks continue to gallop, where could strength emerge beyond that small group? Some other sectors are stirring awake. Consumer discretionary and real estate were livelier last week, outperforming info tech. The small-cap Russell 2000 did well early this week and recently broke out of a long-term trading range where it had wallowed most of the year.  The financials sector—beaten down by bank failures earlier this year—rose about 1.5% over the last five trading days but remains down more than 5% year-to-date. The KBW Regional Banking Index (KRX) recently hit a six-week high as more signs of banking stability emerged. Credit markets are showing little signs of an economic slowdown and the corporate new issue market has picked up lately. One regional bank even issued debt—the first regional bank to do so since the early March bank failures.Seven Horsemen: The Magnificent Seven, by the way, are Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT). Together, they account for about 30% of the SPX’s current market weight and are responsible for almost all SPX gains year-to-date. The term was coined by a Wall Street analyst, and the group includes all but one member of the previous high-net-worth club on Wall Street, the FAANGs. Missing is Netflix (NFLX), though shares of the streaming company are up sharply this year. With a market capitalization of under $200 billion, Netflix simply can’t compete for a place in the Seven with the nearly $1 trillion market-cap of Nvidia. The trouble with FAANG was its exclusion of Microsoft, which analysts often described as an “honorary FAANG.” There were other acronyms, too, like MANA (Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet), and BAT, which included a handful of Chinese tech stocks. Also, TINA (There Is No Alternative) became a popular way to describe stocks when rates were zero, but it exited stage Fed about a year ago.Price check: When the CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports arrive next week, it’s important to focus on the month-over-month data. The year-over-year growth will likely be skewed by last June’s huge inflation jump. Comparisons to a year ago could be easier in June and continue that way at least through the end of this year, causing a discrepancy between annual and monthly inflation growth. The Fed’s annual inflation goal is 2%, and year-over-year numbers now above 4% could slip closer to 3% in coming months simply due to easier comparisons. However, if the monthly core CPI continues to grow by 0.4% or so, as it has most of this year, the Fed might not be done hiking. Many consumer-oriented companies said during earnings season that customers stayed resilient despite rising prices. There may be little keeping companies from ratcheting stickers higher until shoppers balk. That’s bad news if you’re a shopper but potentially good news if you’re an investor hoping for earnings growth through margin expansion. Net profit margin inched up to 11.5% in Q1 for S&P 500 companies, FactSet notes, from 11.3% in Q4. That’s still down from 12.2% a year earlier.CalendarJune 8: April Wholesale Inventories.June 9: No major earnings or data.June 12: No major earnings or dataJune 13: May Consumer Price Index (CPI), beginning of FOMC’s two-day meeting.June 14: FOMC rate decision and May Producer Price Index (PPI). Image sourced from ShutterstockThis post contains sponsored advertising content.

Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Pinterest 2 Mail 0 Are you searching for some of the best penny stocks to buy now? I’m sure that if you’re reading this article, that’s something at the top of your mind. But there’s more to it than just hunting for today’s top movers. Are you day trading? Are you swing trading? Has long-term investing in penny stocks become a recent focus? No matter which style of strategy you’re using, it’s essential to understand that risk and reward play an important role when we’re talking about penny stocks or stocks under $5. That’s thanks, in part, to the inherent volatility in this niche of stocks. Due to their low prices alone, even the slightest price change can equate to a significant percentage fluctuation. Yesterday we discussed penny stocks under $1. That subset of stocks in this niche can see a percentage change of 50% or more from just a drop of 50 cents or less. The same can’t be said for large company stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Regardless, the focus today is on cheap stocks, what’s happening in the stock market today, and if there are any potential opportunities to capitalize on. So where should you begin? The first step in finding the best penny stocks to buy is formulating a watch list. Some traders will focus strictly on technical analysis and momentum. High- and unusual-volume stocks are likely a point of interest. Others will look for something more fundamentally based, like company filings or corporate milestones. Today’s article looks at a list of penny stocks with big news this week. We dive into the details of these announcements and identify any upcoming events that could act as potential catalysts. You can then decide whether these are the best penny stocks to watch this week. Hot Penny Stocks Today Hyzon Motors (HYZN) Hyzon Motors is a supplier of zero-emission heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles. The company offers solutions in the transportation sector. Shares of HYZN stock slowly climbed back since reaching fresh 52-week lows last month. The drop came as Hyzon transitioned some of its leadership team, including its CEO and certain Board members. – 3 Penny Stocks Under $1 To Watch This Week; Time To Buy? HYZN Stock News This week HYZN stock caught a stronger surge of bullish sentiment thanks to a recent deal with Performance Food Group (NYSE: PFGC). The two agreed to five fuel-cell electric vehicles. Commenting on the milestone, Hyzon’s chief executive officer Parker Meeks said, “This agreement for up to 50 hydrogen-powered trucks demonstrates how Hyzon intends to build customer familiarity with a new technology as the hydrogen infrastructure accelerates.” TuSimple Holdings Inc. (TSP) Another one of the automotive tech stocks to watch this week after the news is TuSimple. The company builds autonomous driving technology platforms. It focuses on the automotive industry’s commercial portion and provides fully autonomous deriving solutions for long-haul heavy-duty trucks. TSP Stock News This week TuSimple announced that its autonomous trucks began testing in Japan. As of March, the company’s trucks have logged more than 10 million cumulative miles through testing, research, and freight delivery. Thanks to the driver shortage in Japan, TuSimple aims to tackle this problem head-on and could be a “promising solution,” accounting to CEO Cheng Lu. eFFECTOR Therapeutics (EFTR) We discussed eFFECTOR about a week ago in the article Stock Market Today: New Penny Stocks Trends & 3 To Watch This Week. One of the main highlights and why EFTR stock was on traders’ radars originated from a recently closed financing round. The cancer treatment company has been in the spotlight since the end of April after presenting positive data updates from Phase 2 expansion cohorts. – 4 Penny Stocks To Buy In June According To Insiders These evaluated its zotatifin in breast cancer patients.

EFTR Stock News This week more funding news was announced, which seems to have been received relatively well by the stock market today. eFFECTOR announced an $8.7 million round priced at$1.125 per share. The offering is anticipated to close on June 8th, with proceeds intended for working capital, including funding R&D. Seres Therapeutics (MCRB) Another one of the biotech penny stocks to watch after news this week is Seres Therapeutics. The company specializes in microbiome treatments for serious diseases. Its lead program VOWST  aims to percent the recurrence of C. difficile infection and was granted FDA approval in the US this past April. MCRB Stock News This week, VOWST is back in the news. Seres and Nestlé Health Science announced the commercial availability in the U.S. Greg Behar, Chief Executive Officer of Nestlé Health Science, commented, “Since the approval of VOWST, our teams have engaged with healthcare professionals and are committed to facilitating patient access.” – Trading Penny Stocks for Income, Top Tips Freight Technologies (FRGT) Logistics technology company Freight Technologies saw some signs of recovery in the market for the first time in weeks. Shares have been in a slump since the company announced Q1 earnings. The maker of the Fr8App, a freight-matching platform powered by AI, has released news that sparked some bullishness in the stock market today. FRGT Stock News This week the company announced a new link up with Samsara, which is the maker of Connected Operations Cloud. Fr8App customers can now use insights from Samsara’s technology to optimize logistics operations and ensure delivery timeliness.

Δ Garrett Baldwin Dear Old Friend, First off, happy birthday to my father today… I’m sitting in a rundown hotel in Jamaica, New York City – waiting to catch my flight to Baltimore. What a stark difference from 24 hours ago. The air quality in Switzerland is immaculate, fresh, and inviting. In New York, smoke from Canadian wildfires blankets the East Coast. Instead of a red carpet, New York City rolled out an orange sky for me. Revisiting Our Conversation with Tim, Ben, and Joe. Two days ago, I introduced you to our friends Ben and Joe. But what I didn’t tell you… the two didn’t join us for drinks at Tim Melvin’s house. Tim and I discussed the academic writings of value-investing legends Joseph Piotroski and Ben Graham. We had literature on the table… There was a copy of Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” and Piotroski’s “Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers” in the Journal of Accounting Research. You can learn a lot by reading both and witnessing how their insight can work together to find successful investments. Right now, everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence – despite their insanely high valuations and concerns about hype. Instead – we should be focusing on the things that we need. Tim constantly notes that it’s BORING to buy the stuff we need in this world, right? Energy, food, housing, airlines? Defense? That’s interesting – because we’re already experiencing one of the worst droughts in decades. DECADES. The U.S. corn crop quality plunged last week in the USDA quality report. But you don’t see many people talking about it because it’s food. It’s boring. But Tim always stresses a vital lesson: Boring is better… Boring can provide us with the best investment strategy in the market. And that’s not me saying this. It’s been confirmed by academics. You know… the people who look at data and can tell us that one number is higher than the other (great work, guys). How do we do it? Let’s go deeper into my conversation with Tim. Mister Piotroski Meets Mister Graham Sign up for SMS so you never miss special events, exclusive offers, and weekly bonus trades. Joseph Piotroski is an accounting professor at Stanford University. Before that, he taught at the University of Chicago. He created something called the F score. This nine-point score analyzes the health and strength of a company’s balance sheet. If the company meets the following criteria, it receives a point for each. A “9” is a perfect score. Positive Net Income. Positive return on assets in the current year. Positive operating cash flow in the current year. Cash flow from operations is greater than net Income. Lower ratio of long-term debt in the current period compared to the previous year. Higher current ratio this year compared to the previous year. No new shares were issued in the last year. A higher gross margin compared to the previous year. A higher asset turnover ratio compared to the previous year. A company with a 9 out of 9 has an executive board that is extremely shareholder friendly and interested in boosting shareholder value. Meanwhile, Ben Graham is the godfather of value investing. He’s the man who influenced some of the world’s best long-term investors: Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger… and David Dodd (who worked with Graham at Columbia Business School). Graham and Dodd identified one anomaly that can’t be arbitraged away - regardless of how many machines trade in this market… “Value.” That’s a subject that Tim knows a lot about. Value investing is about deriving the “intrinsic value” of a company’s stock independent of the actual company’s price. So, what does Tim do with his time? He looks at a company’s assets, earnings, and dividend payouts independent of whatever the stock trades for today. So, we use another important metric. Graham developed something called the Graham number. This figure calculates a stock’s underlying value by analyzing a company’s earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS). By default, it creates an upside number that a shareholder should be willing to pay as a defensive investment. Stocks trading at deep discounts to this number can be a unique value. But it’s not enough by itself. In 1987, Warren Buffett wrote something that altered my thinking about the markets. In a letter to shareholders, he said, “We are quite content to hold any security indefinitely, so long as the prospective return on equity capital of the underlying business is satisfactory, management is competent and honest, and the market does not overvalue the business.” Here we find Piotroski's accounting analysis shows us the importance of competent management and an improving return on equity capital. And we see the importance of Graham and Dodd’s analysis to help us recognize if the market is over or under-valuing a stock. Mister Graham, Do Your Dance In 2016, two academics released a study that said, “fundamental signals derived from financial statements allow for future abnormal stock returns.” The article was called “Separating winners from losers: Composite indicators based on fundamentals in the European context.” The authors are Borja Amor-Tapia and Maria T. Tascón from the Universidad de León. What did it uncover? I’ll cut to the chase… You want to buy stocks with strong F scores, cheap Price-to-Graham numbers, and other healthy metrics or other metrics that offer a turnaround-like potential. These offers are stocks with a very nice floor and immense upside for a bounce back. You’d likely be surprised that the stocks on today’s list include housing, energy, mining, and shipping. These companies are incentivizing shareholders to stick around – F scores are strong. Balance sheets are strong. Debt is likely low. Putting This into Action In January, I recommended that readers take a stake in SkyWest Inc. (SKYW). The company is a regional operator of domestic airlines – and caters to larger players in the industry. Think puddle jumpers. Now, I warned that the risk for the company centered around the challenges associated with retaining and hiring new pilots. But at the time, shares were trading at an extremely low Graham number, and it had an F score of 8. And what happened next? SkyWest (SKYW) increased by 107.3% year-to-date, which is better than the YTD performances of Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) (all three are up roughly 40% to 50% this year). If we can buy a handful of these names – and have just one or two beat the market, we could see a portfolio that guides us well in 2023.

A Multi-Time Frame Reviewby John Chang, Benzinga Contributor June 7, 2023 10:02 AM |  4 min read Not to toot my own horn, but I first wrote about the critical 4200 level breakthrough that markets needed to see in order for a bigger move to occur. That article was published May 26th, here's the link:Will the S&P 500 Break Out of 4200 Level? Charts Suggests Possibility Is FavorableAs of writing the article, on June 6th, the index closed 4283 and seemingly we are close to breaking the 4300 levels soon. Before we go through the charts, what are the top three primary factors driving this rally?1. Corporate Earnings:Corporate earnings have generally been strong, surpassing expectations in many cases. As businesses recover and consumer demand rebounds, companies across various sectors are reporting robust financial results. These positive earnings reports are driving investor sentiment and attracting more capital to the stock markets. Just this past earnings season we saw Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL Meta Platforms META just to name a few exceeded expectations. Moreover, technological advancements and innovation continue to play a crucial role in market growth. Companies at the forefront of technology, such as those in the digital transformation, e-commerce, and renewable energy sectors, are experiencing significant growth and attracting investor attention.2. Moderating InflationInflation is a persistent rise in the general level of prices in an economy over a sustained period. It is a complex economic phenomenon that can have significant effects on businesses, consumers, and overall economic stability. Understanding the causes of inflation is crucial for policymakers, investors, and individuals alike. We have seen a significant downturn in headline CPI data for the last 12 months: 3. Markets Pricing In Rate Pause & High EmploymentOne primary objective of the Fed is to maintain price stability. If inflationary pressures are rising and there is a concern that prices may accelerate beyond the desired target, the Fed may opt to raise interest rates. By increasing rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can moderate spending and dampen inflationary pressures. The Feds also monitors the labor market closely. If employment levels reach or exceed full employment, where the majority of individuals who want jobs have them, the Fed may consider raising rates to prevent the economy from overheating. Higher interest rates can help prevent excessive wage growth and maintain a stable labor market. Lastly, Feds is responsible for promoting the stability of the financial system. If there are concerns about excessive risk-taking, speculative bubbles, or imbalances in the financial markets, the Fed may increase interest rates as a precautionary measure. It's expected as of today, there will be a 83% chance of the Feds pausing rate hikes at least for June FOMC:Lastly, if we view the trend on Employment since Covid, it is even more clear to see why the market is breaking through resistances:Now, on to the charts dated end of day June 6th, 2023. Daily Timeframe:Green Line: 200DMA Yellow: 50DMA Orange: 20DMAContructive to say the least for number of reasons. The daily MACD oscillator has truned green over the last several days and the momentum seems toe carry over last serveral days even after blowing past 4200. My short term (end of summer) target is little under 4400, which corresponds with a trendline in WHITE below from October Lows. Likely pull backs will come, as long as index stays above the 20D (4178), we are still in an uptrend. A break down of the 20DMA I expect 50DMA to hold 4134. Weekly Timeframe:While I am bullish for the summer, I'm looking for some backtest of weekly 20DMA in orange at 4101. Why? So far this week, we are trading in a very tight range. We'll have to assess again at week's end. However, starting to run out of steam if we cannot close above 4300 this week. If we do, our summer end's target of 4400 is in view. Monthly Timeframe:Perhaps the most bullish timeframe is the index monthly chart. For one, MACD is flipping cross 0 line. We closed the month of May above the 20MA which was critical for me personally to see a susutained uptrend. If you look back to the 20DMA April 2020, that was the month the index closed above the 20MA. Subsequently we saw one of history's greatest bullrun! As of this writing, monthly candle tested the 20MA and showing strength. Long month to go as market awaits next round of CPI Data, and FOMC rate decision. For more trading signals, education, visit www.therocktradingco.com or sign up for our newsletter here.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Here’s how. Last Updated: June 7, 2023 at 10:49 a.m. ET First Published: June 7, 2023 at 9:51 a.m. ET By Emily Bary comments Wedbush is upbeat about the iPhone 15 cycle and Apple’s ability to win more investor praise for its services momentum Wedbush sees upside potential come the next iPhone cycle. AFP via Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement AAPL +0.01% A big Apple Inc. bull just got more upbeat. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives boosted his price target on Apple shares AAPL, +0.01% to $220 from $205 Wednesday, with his new target now the highest among those tracked by FactSet. The stock recently changed hands just above $179. Ives was optimistic about Apple heading into the iPhone 15 cycle. “Our recent Asia supply chain checks give us further incremental confidence that this upcoming iPhone 15 product cycle could be another trophy case moment for Cupertino kicking off this fall with expected units and ASPs [average selling prices] that could yet another easily surpass current Street expectations,” he wrote in a note to clients.  See also: Apple could be cooking up 3 more $10 billion-plus businesses, one analyst says The company enters the period with a “massive position of strength” in his view, thanks to strong demand for the more expensive Pro-level models, including in the crucial China market. “The initial iPhone units bogey for FY24 looks to be in the ~235 million unit range and we would expect an upside bias,” Ives commented.  Don’t miss: Apple wants its Vision Pro to mark a computing revolution. Early testers say it’s still just a fancy headset. Beyond iPhones lies a compelling narrative around services, he noted. The company will get closer to the $100-billion mark for annual services revenue come fiscal 2024 (FactSet estimates call for $92 billion), which Ives said would be up substantially from just above $50 billion in fiscal 2020.  “Herein lies the key to the valuation re-rating that we believe will continue to take place around Apple’s stock as the Street further appreciates the sheer massive potential of this services revenue that we now assign a valuation in the $1.4 trillion range,” Ives wrote. “We believe Apple’s fair valuation could be in the $3.5 trillion range with a bull case $4 trillion valuation by FY25.” Apple has been hovering above a $2.8 trillion market capitalization.

By Adam Levy – Jun 7, 2023 at 9:40AM Key Points Shares of Apple hit an all-time high ahead of its WWDC announcements. Shares trade at a relatively high P/E multiple for Apple. But the shares may still be worth it for investors. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More $3,499 is a lot for a mixed-reality headset, but is $3 trillion too much for the stock? There were audible groans and boos when Apple (AAPL 1.56%) revealed the price of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will be $3,499. But few investors are balking at the price of Apple stock, which is once again flirting with a $3 trillion market cap. Shares of Apple hit an all-time high price ahead of Apple's big announcement earlier this week at its World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in California. The shares have outperformed both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes by a wide margin year to date. Meanwhile, its valuation is touching levels not seen since the end of 2021, when it last sat near $3 trillion, despite an outlook for a revenue and earnings decline in 2023. Is Apple getting too expensive for both investors and consumers? A hefty price tag Apple shares peaked above a forward P/E ratio of 30 to start the month of June. That's a higher forward P/E than the last time Apple shares traded around the $3 trillion market cap mark. The culprit is expectations that Apple's revenue and earnings per share will decline over the next year. Analysts currently expect a 2.3% decline in EPS and a 2.5% decline in sales for Apple. The Vision Pro won't sway those numbers: The device won't come out until 2024 and probably won't have meaningful sales until fiscal 2025. Over the last 15 years, Apple shares have traded at a trailing P/E above 30 for nine months during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and then briefly again near the end of 2021. With its current P/E of 30.4, it's starting to look quite pricey again. AAPL P/E Ratio data by YCharts. Is Apple worth it? Despite its high price tags, Apple's products (and its stock) are typically worth the price. While the Vision Pro's value may still be up for debate, the stock still looks like a good deal despite the P/E ratio climbing above 30. Apple's stock price is supported by the pile of cash sitting on its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, Apple had $166 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet. While it used debt to access that cash, it still had just $107 billion in debt on the balance sheet, leaving it with $59 billion in net cash. Meanwhile, it's generated nearly $100 billion in free cash flow over the past year, and the outlook remains strong for it to keep the cash machine running. That consistent cash flow and massive stockpile on its balance sheet gives Apple a lot of room to keep buying back shares of the stock and support its stock price. It bought back $39 billion worth of stock in the first half of 2023, and the board authorized a new $90 billion share repurchase program in May. The consistent sales of iPhones and the growth of Apple's high-margin services business are the reasons to buy Apple. It's a cash cow that allows it to return massive amounts of money to shareholders while still investing in products for the future, like Vision Pro. So, even if Vision Pro is an absolute overpriced flop (which I don't think is the case, for the record), Apple will walk away largely unscathed. Even at today's high price, Apple stock is worth buying. Adam Levy has positions in Apple. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

Staff Writer June 7, 2023 6:50 AM |  2 min read Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives believes that Apple Inc. AAPL is heading into the iPhone 15 product cycle from a position of strength. The upcoming iPhone 15 product cycle could be another trophy case moment for Cupertino, with expected units and Average Selling Prices (ASPs) that could easily surpass current Street expectations.The Apple Analyst: Ives is raising his price target from $205 to $220 to reflect increased confidence in this upcoming iPhone cycle and reiterates Apple as an “Outperform” and Wedbush Best Ideas List name.See Also: Should I Buy iPhone 14 Or Wait For iPhone 15The Apple Thesis: Based on Ives’ analysis, approximately 250 million iPhones have not been upgraded in over 4 years, setting Apple up for a major installed base upgrade cycle heading into this anniversary 15-year release. With more Apple customers heading down the Pro path, especially in China, Ives believes ASPs could start to approach the ~$925 level for the iPhone 15 cycle, up roughly $100 in the last 18 months.As reported previously, Apple’s Vision Pro mixed reality headset, priced at a hefty $3,499 and expected to hit the market early next year, is not expected to be a problem. Ives suggests that the headset's capability to integrate gaming, video streaming, conferencing, and health/fitness apps across Apple's ecosystem positions it as a revolutionary product that could potentially outpace competitors.The iPhone 15 lineup is rumored to feature the world's thinnest screen bezels, a ""dynamic island"" feature for quick access to frequently used apps, the A17 Bionic chipset, enhanced HD photography capabilities, and a switch to solid-state buttons from physical ones. Ives forecasts that by fiscal year 2024, Apple’s annual services revenue is expected to be near $100 billion, with a double-digit growth rate. He believes this growth trajectory is crucial for the ongoing re-evaluation of Apple’s stock value. Apple Price Action: Apple stock traded 0.2% higher at $178.82 in the premarket session on Wednesday. Hi, I am the Benzinga Newsbot!

Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More These companies have a history of offering investors solid gains, with coming developments signaling countless growth opportunities. Summer is just around the corner, which often triggers a stock market slump. While sluggishly performing stocks could convince you it's time to sell, keeping a long-term perspective during the warmer months is crucial. The market often rebounds once the air turns chilly, and you won't want to miss out on potential gains. In the meantime, it's a good idea to strengthen your portfolio by investing in companies with a history of growth. Companies like Apple (AAPL 1.56%) and Costco (COST 0.71%) have provided investors with consistent gains for years and have excellent outlooks for 2023. These are two of the best hot stocks to buy in June. 1. Apple Apple stock hit an all-time high on June 5 ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference, thanks to anticipation for the debut of its first augmented reality (AR) headset, which it calls the Vision Pro. The company's shares gained 2% in the early hours of the day, hitting a record $184.90 by midday. The stock lost steam later in the day, falling to $179 a share after Apple announced the headset's eye-watering price of $3,499. However, the downturn doesn't dampen the company's massive potential in AR. Apple shares didn't tumble because its headset lacked innovation, merely because its price doesn't allow it to appeal to the mass market just yet. As a result, an investment in Apple now is not for the success of the current Vision Pro, but for what's possible three or four generations down the line when the price is naturally reduced, making the technology more available to the average consumer. Data from Market Research Future reveals the AR market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 42% through 2030. Meanwhile, Apple's new headset is unlike anything else available, with its advanced capabilities potentially propelling it to the top of the industry. The company has much to gain as the sector develops. Apple's Vision Pro looks to be just the beginning of where AR is headed, with now an excellent time to consider buying this hot stock. 2. Costco As grocery retailers go, Costco is one of the most reliable investment options available. The company's stock has climbed 160% in the last five years. Meanwhile, its annual revenue and operating income have risen over 60% in the same period. The wholesale retailer's unique strategy of selling bulk items at low prices to consumers who are paying an annual membership fee for the privilege has won over shoppers worldwide. In fact, the company's membership renewal rate hit 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% internationally in 2022. Costco currently operates in 14 countries, granting it significant growth opportunities. In France alone, the company has opened two stores since 2017. Its success in the country has led to plans to open 15 additional locations by 2025. With similar potential in many other countries, Costco shares will likely continue climbing for years. Moreover, easing inflation suggests it's not a bad idea to add a retail stock to your list of holdings. Companies in the industry have the most to gain from the improving cost of living, with now an excellent time to invest before it's too late. Costco is one of the best options, thanks to its past gains in the stock market, compared to peers. The chart below illustrates how Costco's stock growth over the last five years is between double and triple the growth of its biggest competitors. Data by YCharts. As Costco continues to expand its global presence and other areas of its business, like its e-commerce division, the company has much to offer investors. Alongside a dividend that has increased for 19 consecutive years, Costco stock is a no-brainer buy this June.

And No, It's Not the Metaverse. By Adria Cimino – Jun 7, 2023 at 6:00AM Key Points This week, Apple announced what may be its next big device: its first spatial computer. The new device may represent a turning point for the company. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More Cook considers Vision Pro ""a huge leap"" into an important technology. Apple's (AAPL 1.56%) history is marked by exciting launches that have transformed the company -- and maybe your lifestyle too. I'm thinking of products like the iPhone or the iPad. But it's been a while since the innovative tech company has unveiled a new game-changing product. The last one actually was the Apple Watch back in 2014. However, the wait may be over. The company announced Vision Pro at its developers conference earlier this week. In an interview with Good Morning America, Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook referred to the device as ""tomorrow's engineering, today."" But Apple isn't calling Vision Pro a step into the metaverse. Instead, Apple is focusing on the idea of spatial computing. Could this be Apple's next big thing? Making your movie screen 100 feet wide First, some details about the device: It's a headset that allows wearers to see apps, messages, and more within their environment. Users can launch a search through a simple voice command and scroll through items with a tap of a finger. Vision Pro promises to make your movie screen feel 100 feet wide -- right there in your living room. Users also can look at their own photos and videos at life-size scale. And those are just a couple of examples of what this new device can do. Users feel as if they're really in the middle of the action as they watch movies, TV programs, or sporting events, Cook said on Good Morning America. So, it's an exciting moment for technology fans. But it also is an exciting moment for Apple. Vision Pro is the ""most advanced piece of electronics equipment out there,"" Cook said during the interview. He called augmented reality a ""profound technology"" that Apple has been working on for a while. ""This is the next chapter in that, and it's a huge leap,"" the CEO said. It's clear that the product is a major innovation. But the question now is whether it will stand out as Apple's previous innovations have done -- and how it may impact revenue. Vision Pro comes with a hefty price tag: at least $3,499, the company says. That's compared to Meta Platforms' Quest 3 that should launch later this year for $499. Budget-conscious technology fans may opt for the Meta product. Even if the Apple product is superior, it may be difficult to sell Vision Pro to a wide audience at such a price level. That said, at this price, Apple may not need a huge audience. My colleague Nicholas Rossolillo wrote about how Apple just needs to sell 1.9 million Vision Pro devices to equal the iPad's revenue from last quarter. This means Vision Pro could become Apple's next big thing -- even if it doesn't attract a huge audience. A key step for Apple And, right now, Vision Pro is a key step for Apple because it brings the company into a new era of technology. It's still too early to say whether this device will be a stepping stone for Apple in spatial computing, or if it will truly take off. But Apple's strong device track record is good reason to be optimistic about the company's position in spatial computing over the long term. One key point to watch is the pace of development of applications for Vision Pro. Apple's developer community can harness the power of Vision Pro to create new app experiences, for example. Whether Vision Pro immediately brings revenue growth to Apple or not, all of this means it still could be yet another game-changing device for the company.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research The Role of Technology in Mastercard's Growth By Rob Starks Jr – Jun 7, 2023 at 6:00AM Key Points Mastercard has a strong track record of finding payment and technology trends early. The company faces enormous competition and must continuously innovate to stay relevant. Mastercard has recently made strategic acquisitions to expand its global reach and capabilities. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: MA Mastercard Market Cap $355B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.65%) $6.09 Current Price $375.31 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More This payment processor is at the forefront of developing new technology. Although established a lifetime ago in 1966, Mastercard (MA 1.65%) is far from an outdated credit card company. On the contrary, it stands out among the world's most advanced financial technology (fintech) enterprises. It leverages cutting-edge technology to deliver innovative payment solutions globally to consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and governments. Here's a look at how Mastercard is taking the lead in developing new payment technologies, as well as positioning itself for growth. As a result, it will be challenging for new fintech competitors to unseat Mastercard in the payments industry. It catches on to the latest payment trends early The company employs experts who constantly monitor the ever-evolving payments landscape and quickly identify emerging trends. Mastercard also partners with various organizations, including financial institutions, merchants, and governments, to remain on the cutting edge and be among the first to establish itself in many lucrative areas of the payment industry. Here are some payment trends that Mastercard discovered early: Increased use of contactless card payments.Mastercard was one of the first companies to offer contactless payments in 2008, well before contactless payments became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic due to consumers viewing them as safer and cleaner than cash. During its latest earnings report, Mastercard Chief Executive Office Michael Miebach said, ""Over 100 markets have reached at least 50% contactless penetration, double the number three years ago."" The growth of mobile payments.The company has partnered with several mobile payment providers, such as Apple Pay and Alphabet's Google Pay, to make it easier for customers to make payments with their smartphones. Its latest innovation, Tap on Phone, enables businesses to approve payments from any contactless card or a mobile wallet using a device capable of near-field communication, making it easier for businesses of all sizes to accept contactless payments. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in payments.Mastercard is a leader in harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the payment process. It uses AI in various ways, including fraud detection, customer service, and marketing. The company has invested heavily in AI and is collaborating with multiple partners to develop new payment solutions aided by AI. Central banks creating digital currencies.The company is a leader in creating solutions that can help central banks launch and manage a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the public to use in day-to-day payments. Many governments would like to replace cash with CBDC. Mastercard has many experts working on various CBDC-related projects, including developing new payment rails, building new security features, and creating new compliance solutions. One word of caution Despite its considerable advantages as a first mover in many lucrative areas of the payments industry, Mastercard faces significant competition from various players in the market, including payment processors such as Visa (V 1.17%) and Stripe and online payment companies like PayPal (PYPL 0.38%) and Block (SQ -1.14%). This competition poses a major risk to the company, and if it ever needs to lower its fees to remain competitive, that could result in decreased profits. Additionally, Mastercard may lose market share if competitors offer better products or services, leading to lower revenue. The company counters competition by continuing to innovate to stay ahead. If any expertise is too expensive or will take too long to develop in-house, Mastercard will acquire companies with the technology. Some exciting acquisitions In recent years, Mastercard has made many tuck-in acquisitions to acquire exciting technology that helps keep it at the forefront of the payment industry's technological battles. A tuck-in acquisition is a small, strategic acquisition that complements an existing business. One of the most important acquisitions was Aiia, a developer-first open banking technology. Open banking allows third-party financial providers, such as fintechs and personal financial management (PFM) apps, to access consumers' bank financial data, giving them more control and access to new and innovative financial services -- a potentially huge business. Some of these services include personalized financial advice, such as recommendations for investments or savings products, while PFM apps allow users to view their financial data from all their accounts in one place, helping them track spending, discover ways to save money, and better understand their overall financial health. Additionally, third-party providers can use this data to facilitate faster, more convenient account-to-account payments, which are superior to traditional methods such as checks or wire transfers. Allied Market Research valued the global open banking market size at $13.9 billion in 2020. It expects this market to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.3% from 2023 to 2031 to $123.7 billion. Next, Mastercard's recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks is another excellent step in the company's multilayered approach to security. Baffin Bay Networks is an AI-enabled automated cloud-based security service that can stop cyberattacks related to malware, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. This acquisition will allow Mastercard to provide its customers with even greater security and peace of mind. Last, the purchase of Dynamic Yield was yet another vital acquisition for Mastercard. Acquiring Dynamic Yield will help the company strengthen its personalization capabilities and better compete with other payment technology companies. The platform uses AI to deliver personalized customer experiences that its clients can use to personalize websites, mobile apps, email marketing campaigns, and other customer touchpoints -- a wide range of businesses already use the platform, including McDonald's, Deckers Brands, and Sephora. Does its technology provide a reason to buy the stock? Mastercard's payment technology gives the company a competitive advantage. Its payment processing network is one of the most secure and efficient in the world. Moreover, throughout its history, it has committed to innovation and looking for new ways to better its services to exceed customer expectations. As a result, its technology gives investors many compelling reasons to consider buying the stock. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Reuters June 07, 2023 / 06:11 AM IST US stocks end up as Fed, CPI loom large next week   U.S. stocks closed up on Tuesday, helped by some advances in economically sensitive sectors, as investors awaited inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy meet next week.Inflation data is expected to show consumer prices cooled slightly on a month-over-month basis in May but core prices are likely to have remained elevated, and the Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates.Major indexes wavered as investors took a breather after pushing the S&P 500 up almost 20% from its October 2022 lows, boosted by gains in megacap stocks, a stronger-than-expected earnings season and hopes that the U.S. central bank is nearing the end of its interest rate-hike cycle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 10.42 points, or 0.03%, to 33,573.28, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 10.06 points, or 0.24%, to 4,283.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 46.99 points, or 0.36%, to 13,276.42.""It looks like investors are gaining a little optimism,"" said Cresset Capital CIO Jack Ablin.

The Russell 2000 index (.RUT) of small-cap companies added 2.69%.Recent economic data and dovish remarks from Fed officials have raised the odds of the Fed holding interest rates at its June 13-14 meeting.Fed fund futures indicate traders have priced in a near 80% chance that the central bank will hold interest rates in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool. However, they see 50% odds of another 25-basis-point rate hike in July.Coinbase Global (COIN.O) plunged 12.09% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the crypto exchange, accusing it of illegally operating without having first registered with the regulator.Apple Inc (AAPL.O) extended losses to slip 0.21%, a day after the iPhone maker unveiled a costly augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O).Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) rose 5.34% after Piper Sandler raised the price target on the stock to $150, the second highest on Wall Street, as per Refinitiv data.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.59-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 69 new lows.

Companies known as Big Tech, including Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.03%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.88%, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.81%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.32%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.36%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, +1.12% and Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.64%, now represent 27.4% of the S&P 500 after soaring in 2023, a DataTrek note Tuesday shows. These “seven stocks are just over a quarter of the S&P after starting the year as one-fifth of the index,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in the note. “One might have convincingly argued that even 20 percent was too high a weighting, but that has not stopped this cohort from gobbling up even more S&P 500 ‘market share’.” Big Tech has “gained 7.4 points of S&P 500 weighting” in 2023, exceeding the weighting of the index’s entire large-cap energy sector,  according to the note. The energy sector weighs in at 4.2% of the S&P 500.  Meanwhile, the amount of Big Tech’s added weight this year is also about triple the 2.5% the materials sector represents in the index, said Colas. Shares of Big Tech companies have skyrocketed this year against “an otherwise standstill U.S. equity market,” driving the S&P 500’s gains, according to the note. The index, which is a gauge of large-cap stocks in the U.S., has climbed 11.6% this year through Tuesday.  The S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% closed slightly higher Tuesday, remaining on the cusp of breaking out of its bear market as the index is nearly 20% above its closing low last year in October.  Read: Why the broader U.S. stock market has ‘a lot riding’ on Big Tech earnings “There’s nothing inherently wrong with a market that chooses to only reward some combination of cost cutting and new technology, but it is far from either the norm or the ideal setup,” said Colas.  While the rest of the S&P 500 may be starting to benefit from “stabilizing” expectations for company earnings against the backdrop of still “reasonably strong” economic growth, as well as from “incremental clarity” over the past few weeks on the debt ceiling and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meetings this month and July, “we will want to see more proof before being convinced of its permanence.” Seven of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors rose Tuesday, with financials posting the strongest performance with a sharp gain of 1.3%, according to FactSet data. While Big Tech is trading at an average 44.2x the group’s forward 12-month earnings, the S&P 500’s much smaller energy sector trades for 10x forward earnings while the materials sector is valued at 15.8x, according to DataTrek.  Big Tech valuations are “high,” said Colas, with Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet and Meta being “somewhat high” while Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla are “extremely high.” Advertisement Advertisement Partner Center Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Most Popular Advertisement U.S. stock futures point higher after May inflation data meets forecasts Inflation slows again, CPI shows, and might keep Fed on sidelines Apple’s stock is no longer worth buying after reaching a record, says Wall Street firm How to invest in art without spending millions of dollars Tesla, Amazon, Ford stocks rise more as tame inflation data gives a boost to consumer discretionary sector Advertisement Advertisement Read Next Read Next Barron's: These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Carnival, Nasdaq, SoFi, and More Tesla is rising for a 12th consecutive day, Carnival trades higher after Wall Street upgrades the stock, and Nasdaq falls after agreeing to acquire software company Adenza for $10.5 billion in cash and shares.

Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement MSFT +0.88% NVDA +1.36% AAPL -0.02% AMZN +0.32% TSLA +1.65% SPX +0.50% SP500.40 -0.09% SP500.20 +0.69% SP500.50 +1.20% SP500.45 +2.07% DJIA +0.34% COMP +0.69% Cyclical value stocks, including shares of companies in the financials, industrials and basic materials sectors will play a catch-up to outperforming megacap technology shares heading into the third quarter of 2023, broadening the stock-market rally and lifting the benchmark S&P 500 index to 4,400, a closely followed Wall Street analyst forecast on Tuesday. “Most gains since October 2022 were cyclical growth, technology, for example, but now we see cyclical value such as basic materials, industrials, financials in a catch-up price-to-earnings ratio led rally to the third quarter of 2023, which broadens the market while limiting cap-weighted index upside,” said Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, in a Monday note. The cyclical growth category includes software (Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.88% -dominated), semiconductors (Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.36% -dominated), tech hardware (Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.02% -dominated), retailing (Amazon.com AMZN, +0.32% -dominated), media, autos (Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.65% -dominated) and apparels, while the cyclical value category includes banks, materials, transportation, real estate, capital goods and insurance, according to Stifel.  Most of the stock-market gains so far in 2023 have been powered by a handful of tech-focused names, whose weighting in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% is at a historically high level. They have helped lift the index higher by 11.6% this year and had it on the verge of exiting its longest bear-market run since 1948. However, a top-heavy concentration usually indicates limited participation and is not sustainable over the long term.  That’s why a “catch-up” rally in cyclical value stocks could help broaden out the stock-market advance, but it will restrict the future upside for the cap-weighted S&P 500 as companies in the cyclical value category only account for 24% of the index, while the cyclical growth represents a notable 44%, Bannister said. Among the 11 sectors of the S&P 500, the financials sector SP500.40, -0.09% has risen 2.1% over the past month, while the industrials sector SP500.20, +0.69% has advanced 1% and the materials sector has shed 1.2% over the same period. At the other end of the spectrum, the communication services SP500.50, +1.20% and information technology sectors SP500.45, +2.07% have jumped over 10%, thanks to robust gains in megacap growth and tech stocks, according to FactSet data.  Strategists at Stifel divide the 24 industries in the S&P 500 into four quadrants based on economic growth, which affects earnings-per-share, versus inflation, which has affected price-to-earnings ratio since 1990. The chart below shows the cyclical growth stocks have been overbought since the start of 2023 when strategists compared their shares with their 50- and 200-day moving averages.  However, stocks in the cyclical value category have been oversold in the same period and are poised to rebound when “global GDP firms, U.S. dollar weakens, and the Federal Reserve officially reaches the end of its interest-rate hiking cycle,” the strategists said. SOURCE: BLOOMBERG DATA, STIFEL ESTIMATES “Since Oct. 24, 2022, we’ve preferred the cyclical quadrants (at right), seeing no near-term recession and high but cooler inflation,” said Bannister.  However, Bannister is still cautious over the longer term as he sees reasons to watch out for a “textbook” recession in late 2023 and flattening earnings growth by year end. The 50-day moving average of the 3M-10Y Treasury yield curve shows recession risk in September 2023, with “no false signals the past 55 years in 8 recessions,” said Bannister (see chart below). SOURCE: BLOOMBERG DATA, STIFEL ESTIMATES “We believe recessions and bear markets are surprises and not so widely anticipated, leaving consensus sentiment since Oct. 2022 off-sides, but risk may indeed rise in 4Q23 and beyond,” said Bannister.  “As the 2023 slowdown proves mild the economy encounters resource constraints late-2023 or 1H24, and because there is no economic reset as sought by the Fed, then between 4Q23 and 2Q24 there may be policy or economic risk.”  U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday as investors remained cautious and awaited the May CPI data and Fed’s interest-rate decision due next week. The S&P 500 was up 10 points, or 0.2%, to 4,283, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.34% ended flat and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.69% advanced 0.4%.

Fiverr is down by double-digit percentages over the past year, but looking past the volatility is warranted. Apple saw shares pop nearly 50% just in 2023, and an upcoming launch could help it rise further. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: FVRR Fiverr International Market Cap $1B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (4.74%) $1.31 Current Price $28.95 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More A bear market could impact these stocks, but likely not for long. Growth stocks aren't boosting investors' returns at the rate they were a few years ago, but it's not all doom and gloom. Great businesses continue to thrive in what is arguably an uncertain macroeconomic environment that has investors divided about what to do with their money. Here are two companies performing well on a business level that beg a second look from investors regarding their stocks. Both of these unstoppable growth stocks look ripe for multi-year buy-and-hold investments in 2023 and beyond. 1. Fiverr International Fiverr International (FVRR 4.74%) got increased attention from investors in the pandemic era when millions of people were forced to stay at home for extended periods which resulted in a notable boom in remote work and gig work. The growth has certainly slowed from that peak pandemic period. Still, there's a lot to like about this stock, particularly when you evaluate its growth story in light of the bigger picture of the industry in which it operates and its progress over the last few years. Fiverr finished out the first quarter of this year with 4.3 million active buyers of freelance services on its platform, and spending per buyer hitting $262 (spending, in this case, is the 5.5% service fee Fiverr collects on top of the fees that go to the seller for services rendered). These two figures represented increases of 0.3% and 4% from the year-ago period. Taking a step back, that active buyer count was up 74% compared to the same quarter in 2020, while spending per buyer rose 48% on a three-year clip. Fiverr continues to expand the vast range of services (gigs) that freelancers can offer to clients and businesses on the platform as well. For example, the rise of AI has pervaded many segments of the labor economy, and the gig economy is no different. Even as searches and offerings for AI-focused gigs have expanded rapidly in recent months, Fiverr's management has been clear that these tools aren't replacing the need for actual gig workers. The first-quarter earnings report noted: We are also seeing higher quality of work deliveries as freelancers leverage the latest generative AI tools. Fiverr's marketplace is highly dynamic. Just as consumer preferences continue to evolve in a physical goods marketplace, on Fiverr, services and job skills continue to evolve as well. When new waves of technology advancements occur, these often are the golden moments for category expansion on our marketplace followed by an influx of supply and demand. We believe the recent advancement of AI technology creates such a golden moment to lean into our category expansion as a long-term growth driver. Between 2019 and 2022, Fiverr's revenue expanded at a compound annual growth rate of 47%. Compare that to the pace of growth of the broader global gig economy, which is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 16% in the seven-year period between 2021 and 2028, according to Business Research Insights. It's also worth noting that in 2022, 27% of Fiverr's revenue was from new buyers, while an incredible 63% was from repeat buyers. In short, once a buyer -- whether that be a solo entrepreneur or a large enterprise -- joins the Fiverr platform, they tend to stay with it for a long time. Fiverr's growth journey may be changing, but its business looks more relevant than ever. 2. Apple Apple (AAPL 1.56%) made headlines this week for announcing a significant new hardware product: its eagerly awaited mixed reality headset. The product, officially called the Vision Pro, made its first public appearance at the Worldwide Developers Conference. The headset won't be commercially available until early next year, and it will come with a $3,499 price tag. Vision Pro is a virtual reality headset, an augmented reality headset and it also functions as a 3D camera. Beyond running Apple's app offerings, the headset will be able to integrate with a wide range of third-party apps being created by well-known industry leaders. Microsoft and Walt Disney are just two of the companies building apps to operate on Vision Pro. Users will be able to navigate Microsoft's productivity apps from the headset or stream Disney+ shows. The Vision Pro will also enable pairings with other Apple products. It's powered by Apple's industry-leading M2 chip, and also runs a brand new R1 chip which is designed to reduce the potential for motion sickness. When it's released, Apple hopes to seize a significant share in the highly fragmented multi-billion-dollar virtual reality headset market. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market was valued at about $12 billion in 2021 but is expected to balloon to a valuation of $227 billion by the year 2029. That's a compound annual growth rate of 45%. The company's focus on creating a mixed reality headset that can service a wide range of user needs, rather than focusing on gaming as the primary use case, looks like a solid strategy to capture added market share. Beyond the Vision Pro, Apple announced several other updates this week, including a new Macbook Pro. Importantly, the company still makes most of its revenue from iPhone sales. The second-most-prominent slice of its sales comes from its services segment, which revolves mostly around subscription-based products like Apple Music. Over the trailing 12 months, Apple pulled in revenue of $385 billion and net income of $94 billion. It also produced operating cash flow to the tune of $110 billion. While a challenging macro environment affected Apple's pace of growth, the tech giant is still a highly profitable cash machine that continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of its customers while generating growth from its industry-leading products. The future still looks very exciting for Apple and its long-term shareholders. Rachel Warren has positions in Apple.

June 6, 2023 9:24 AM |  2 min read Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd TSM cut its 2023 capital expenditure outlook to closer to the bottom end of the previously forecast $32 billion - $36 billion range. TSMC reaffirmed projections for revenue in the first half of 2023 to decline by about 10% in U.S. dollar terms, Bloomberg cites Chairman Mark Liu's statement to reporters after hosting the firm's annual shareholders' meeting on Tuesday. The update reflects the critical Apple Inc AAPL supplier's struggle with weak demand for smartphones and computing chips amid an uneven post-Covid Chinese economic recovery. Also Read: What's Going On With Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Tuesday TSMC reaffirmed a low- to mid-single-digit revenue decline in 2023 — about in line with estimates amid the global tech slump and uncertainty over the revival of China's economy. Liu acknowledged undergoing an inventory adjustment period, with recovery in some end markets. TSMC expected its sales to drop slightly in 2023 but is ready to capture substantial growth starting in 2024. Liu discussed TSMC's longer-term prospects while expressing confidence about a broader 2024 sector recovery. The partner to AI chip designer Nvidia Corp NVDA expects a multiplication of AI services on mobile devices driving demand for the advanced chips. TSMC plans to double its advanced chip packaging capacity, Liu told reporters. In 2022, sales from high-performance computing surpassed smartphones for the first time, Liu said. He expected the rise of generative AI to firm up that trend. TSMC has been diversifying its manufacturing footprint over the past two years to mitigate customer concerns over geopolitical uncertainties in the Taiwan Strait. Price Action: TSM shares closed lower by 0.07% at $97.98 premarket on the lat check Tuesday. © 2023 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

The federal government versus the crypto industry. The SEC before the bell Tuesday sues Coinbase (COIN), accusing the company of acting as an unregistered broker and exchange. Coinbase, whose shares sank 20% on the news, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. 2. The action taken by the top U.S. securities regulator comes one day after it sued Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging the comingling of funds. The SEC also says Binance used market-making firms it controlled to inflate trading prices and profit off of their customers. Binance dismissed the charges. 3. Price target boosts on Wall Street for Club name Apple (AAPL) after the tech giant unveiled a new mixed-reality headset. While keeping their buy-rating equivalents, Wells Fargo goes to $210 per share from $185 and Credit Suisse goes to $200 from $188. Others are not as positive: Deutsche Bank cites hefty $3,499 starting price for Vision Pro. DA Davidson says the device is already priced into the stock. 4. We see it differently, looking at the promise of the headset not really being about the headset. Ahead of Monday's Vision Pro announcement, Apple shares hit an all-time high. The headset was the ""one more thing"" at Apple's developers conference kickoff presentation. The stock, however, turned lower by the end of the session. 5. Bank of America says to hold Molson Coors (TAP) amid the Bud Light boycott. Boosts price target on TAP to $68 per share from $54. In beer, we own and like Corona and Modelo maker Constellation Brands (STZ). In a recent commentary, we argued the case for STZ over TAP . Jefferies increases STZ price target to $293 from $285; keeps buy rating. 6. Dollar General (DG) downgraded by Wells Fargo to equal weight from overweight (hold from buy). Cuts price target to $165 per share from $178. Amazing how much this one is now hated after a train wreck of a quarter. I think cost-conscience consumers are going to Walmart (WMT) and Club name Costco (COST) 7. The Dow , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for a relatively flat open; one week out from the start of the Fed's two-day June meeting. Friday's strong jobs report did little to steer market odds away for an interest rate hike pause next week, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. 8. Chances for a Fed rate increase in July stands at roughly 52% in favor. May inflation data is out next week while Fed policymakers gather to deliberate monetary policy. Questions remain whether the Fed has done enough already to tamp down inflation and cool the labor market, or whether there's more to do. 9. Spice maker McCormick (MKC) gets a double upgrade to buy from underperform (sell) at Bank of America, which also boosts price target to $100 per share from $75. Cites improved outlook for costs and margins as well as easier year-over-year volume comps. Meanwhile, Campbell Soup (CPB) posts solid topline quarterly growth. 10. Atlantic Equities starts FedEx (FDX) with an overweight (buy) rating and $265 per share price target, citing cost-cutting and a move to ""flexible, margin enhancing."" JPMorgan is more cautious, lowering its PT to $228 from $233 and keeping its neutral rating. Still a self-help situation. Earnings are due out later this month.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Can Apple's New VR Headset Reignite the Metaverse Buzz? By Nicholas Rossolillo – Jun 6, 2023 at 8:28AM Key Points Apple just announced its mixed reality device Vision Pro, available in 2024 for $3,499. Apple brought along a couple of key partners in Disney and Unity Software that will help fill up Apple's content pipeline. At such a steep price point, Vision Pro may not spark renewed mainstream interest in the metaverse, but it could still be a profitable addition to the Apple family. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Apple enters the virtual 3D world industry, and (sort of) brings some competition to Meta's Quest headsets. Apple's (AAPL 1.56%) upcoming product, the first new device category launch since the Apple Watch was announced in 2014, was no closely held secret. Rumors have been abundant about development of a virtual reality (VR) or mixed reality headset -- a medium that would bring users into the so-called metaverse, or a 3D rendering of the internet. The wait is over. Vision Pro has been revealed. The only problem is it won't be available until 2024, and it carries a hefty price tag of $3,499. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META 2.30%) likely feels safe with its own new headset announcement, the Quest 3, available later in 2023 for $499. Nevertheless, Meta's efforts to date haven't set off widespread adoption of the metaverse. Could Apple's VR headset reignite the buzz? Apple's long road to Vision Pro Apple product fans have had to wait a long time since a brand new type of device was introduced. It's been over eight years since Beats Electronics and Beats Music were acquired, and the Apple Watch made its debut. Data source: Apple. Image by author. Over this span of time, Apple's power as a superior investment hasn't diminished, but revenue growth has certainly slowed. Data by YCharts. The timing of Vision Pro is thus timely, and not just because Apple needs another product to fuel growth. The world has changed drastically in the last few years, and digital work and play are now a ubiquitous part of daily life. Thus the desire (from some) for the metaverse, which creates a 3D digital experience that mimics the real world, rather than requiring users to bounce from one screen to another throughout the day. But in the aftermath of the pandemic, there's been pushback against the metaverse and total immersion in digital experiences. Where Meta has failed to gain widespread acceptance, Apple hopes to propel VR to the next level -- much like it did for the smartphone industry in 2007. Vision Pro aims to do this by allowing users to choose how ""immersed"" they are -- from a camera-based portrayal of the space they are in filled in with apps, to a full virtually rendered environment of their choosing. Apple gets some help from partners Video games and entertainment are often the gateway to VR, and Apple is taking a similar approach here. The company showed off how Vision Pro emulates a big screen TV for viewing photos, videos, and TV and movie content. There will also be a new App Store specifically for Vision Pro, Disney (DIS 1.32%) CEO Bob Iger also joined the event to talk up the device. Disney+ will be available on Vision Pro at product launch, as well as interactive content built using Disney's sizable library of IP (from classic Disney animation to Star Wars to the Marvel superhero universe). And on the video game front, Vision Pro developers can tap into video game and 3D content creation platform Unity Software (U -0.85%). Shares of Unity rocketed more than 20% higher on the announcement. Unity's business has been dealing with issues in recent years, so the partnership was viewed as a positive development for the software company. Apple says other companies are developing 3D apps for Vision Pro for play and work, including Microsoft's Office work suite and Adobe's creativity, design, and content editing software. The Apple advantage Many of the features on Vision Pro aren't exactly new. Meta has already released some sort of iteration of most of the capabilities on Apple's headset. In fact, one could argue that Vision Pro's need to remain plugged in throughout the day, or rely on a battery that provides only up to two hours of use, is a serious hindrance. Meta's current-gen headset, Quest 2, has been rated at two to three hours of battery life (Quest 3 battery life details haven't been released yet). Nevertheless, though Meta has more than 3.8 billion monthly active users via its social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), that hasn't translated to widespread headset sales. Apple, on the other hand, has a global installed base of more than 2 billion devices in operation. And therein lies the real Apple advantage, in my opinion. Apple users are fans, they're locked into a large ecosystem of existing devices spanning PCs to phones to earbuds and watches, and they regularly refresh these devices with a new purchase. An increasing number of businesses are adopting Apple hardware too. It wouldn't take many of these devoted fans and businesses making a Vision Pro purchase to jump-start a successful new device segment for Apple -- especially not when each headset costs $3,499 a pop! At full price, it would take only 1.9 million Vision Pro sales to match revenue from the iPad last quarter (Apple reportedly shipped about 10.8 million iPads in Q1 calendar year 2023, bringing in revenue of $6.67 billion). But will Vision Pro rekindle the metaverse buzz? Probably not at its steep price point. Vision Pro could be a nice profitable addition to the Apple family that can reward shareholders, but the world still feels years away from mainstream mixed reality device adoption. For now, this seems like a virtual experience for a select group of early adopters, more than a watershed moment like the iPhone was.
