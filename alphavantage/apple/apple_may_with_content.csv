Here's a recap of Thursday's key moments. Not overbought yet Wynn downgraded Amazon is about margins 1. Market is not overbought yet U.S. stocks rose Thursday, led by the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite , which has outperformed the S & P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average all year long. Club holdings Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) helped fuel the gains. The market hasn't quite entered overbought territory yet, but that may happen if the broader rally persists. ""As we get overbought, I want [Club members] to be more careful,"" Jim Cramer said. Before the market open, the Labor Department said initial jobless claims in the week ended June 3 totaled 261,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis, well above the Dow Jones estimate of 235,000. 2. Wait on Wynn Jim said he's not ready to pound the table on Wynn Resorts (WYNN) just yet. The casino operator fell more than 1% on Tuesday after Jefferies downgraded the stock to hold from buy and reduced its price target to $114 per share from $135. Jim said he recognizes that China's post-Covid recovery hasn't lived up to expectations, carrying implications for Wynn's business in Macao, a special administrative region of China. However, Jim said he sees continued strength in Wynn's Las Vegas operations. 3. Own Amazon for margins Research analysts at competing Wall Street firms published fresh research on Amazon, with different focuses in the notes. Wells Fargo expressed optimism around the tech giant's ability to expand margins in its crucial North American business, while UBS touted a reacceleration of AWS revenue growth in the fourth quarter of this year. Both firms have the equivalent of a buy rating on Amazon stock. While we also believe an artificial intelligence-powered AWS reacceleration looms , Jim said he's partial to Wells Fargo's emphasis on margins. ""That is the call,"" he said. ""If you own it [Amazon] for AI, that will prove to be disappointing to you,"" he added. (Jim Cramer's Charitable Trust is long AMZN, AAPL, MSFT and WYNN. See here for a full list of the stocks.)

Alex Coffey June 8, 2023 11:22 AM |  8 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Thursday market open) Smoke isn’t the only thing blowing in from Canada this week. A rate hike north of the border raised concerns on Wall Street, but by and large the market still seems confident of a Federal Reserve rate pause next Wednesday.The small-cap focused Russell 2000® (RUT) rose to a three-month high yesterday even as previously sizzling sectors like info tech and communication services lost ground. The Bank of Canada’s quarter-point rate hike Wednesday likely played into tech weakness, raising concerns the Fed might follow suit. Higher bond yields both at home and abroad also might reflect Canada’s move.Even before the Canada news, there had been pullback lately in some of the mega-cap stocks that propelled this year’s rally. Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT recently hit 52-week highs, as did semiconductor firm Nvidia NVDA. All three are well below water so far this week and suffered sharp losses Wednesday. It’s possible some profit-taking occurred after their performance far outpaced the rest of the market year-to-date. Apple and Microsoft both lost more ground overnight, but major indexes were mixed in premarket trading.These mega-caps often set the entire market’s direction, so watch them closely the next few days to see if buyers come in at the lower prices or if selling continues. Also keep an eye on market volume, which was higher than normal yesterday. Heavier volume can sometimes indicate a stronger sense of conviction among market participants. Volume was generally light last month as major indexes rose to nine-month highs, but it was notably heavy Wednesday as tech stocks lost ground.On the “cup is half full” side, however, advancers outpaced decliners yesterday on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and new 52-week highs outpaced new 52-week lows, Briefing.com says.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) climbed 2 basis points to the high end of its recent range at 3.81%. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) continued easing from recent highs to 103.8. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures rose slightly to 14.09 but remain near three-year lows. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) has been climbing this week and recently traded at $73.22 per barrel. Just inThis week has been a “news vacuum,” according to one Wall Street analyst. However, today brings tidings in the form of initial weekly jobless claims. They spiked to 261,000, well above analysts’ expectations for 237,000 and close to the highest level this year. Higher claims tend to indicate a slowing labor market, but it would likely take several weeks or even months to be a trend. Generally, the market associates recessions with claims of 300,000 or more. Still, Treasury yields eased immediately after the data.In other news, Eurozone Q1 Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was revised to -0.1% compared to the earlier estimate of 0.1% growth. Q4 growth also got checked, with the new estimate at -0.1%. That puts Europe technically into a small recession, Trading Economics observes.Eye on the FedChances of an interest rate pause at the June meeting stand at 71% this morning, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which also prices in a nearly 70% chance that rates will rise by July. These numbers haven’t moved much the last few days, reinforcing ideas that a pause is likely next week.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starts next Tuesday—the very day of the critical May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. The Fed will announce its decision next Wednesday afternoon.Northern lights: Western central banks often, though not always, raise and lower rates in unison. This month might be one of those times when they don’t. The Bank of Canada’s quarter-point rate hike Wednesday after a long pause surprised U.S. market participants and probably was partially responsible for the info tech sector’s poor performance yesterday, as that sector is often more sensitive to rate worries.Concern showed up more in the equities market than in fed funds futures, which still indicate strong chances for a Fed pause next week, only slightly lower than they did before the news from up north.While Canada’s economy often moves in parallel with its southern neighbor, Canada’s consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.7% in April. That inflation reading far exceeded economists’ expectations and compared with 0.4% in the United States. Canada wasn’t the only former British territory to jack up rates this week. Australia’s central bank raised its benchmark rate to an 11-year high.What to WatchNo drum roll: Friday is another day with no major data release on the calendar, and Monday doesn’t look much more exciting. That means anyone who loves watching numbers will have to be patient and wait for the deluge of data later next week.Sick day: Remember that a quiet market sometimes can be more prone to moving on outside influences like geopolitics or even the weather. One development drawing attention this week is an outbreak of COVID-19 in China. That might not have attracted much notice if things were busier on Wall Street. China’s recent economic data has been mixed as the country reopens from its pandemic lockdown. Any signs of the illness returning raises concerns about the possible impact on China’s growth, as well as its import demand. Cases are expected to peak at only 25% of the last wave, and so far there’s been only a slight moderation in activity based on anecdotal reports and high-frequency mobility measures such as subway traffic, according to the Schwab Center for Financial Research.Stocks in the SpotlightSoup and crackers: It’s said hot soup can refresh on a summer day, but Campbell CPB shares cooled yesterday after the company delivered earnings that some analysts labeled as disappointing.On the surface things looked about right as Campbell beat Wall Street’s earnings per share estimates, reported in-line revenue, and reaffirmed previous guidance. But the earnings beat was only half of what the company delivered earlier this year, Briefing.com notes. And the company’s Meals and Beverages segment saw revenue fall 2%—a somewhat puzzling result considering there is a durable eat-at-home trend, according to retail sector analysts.The snacks category, which includes those ubiquitous Goldfish crackers, was strong in the quarter, rising 12%. Salty snacks remained popular, it seems, even if the soup spoons stayed in the drawer.Unwinding: Over the last year, the S&P Real Estate Select Sector Index ($IXRE) is down more than 15% while the S&P Info Tech Select Sector Index (IXT) is up more than 19%, forming the top and bottom sectors on the one-year scorecard. This week there’s been a slight unwinding of that huge gap, with real estate hustling higher and tech giving up some gains. CHART OF THE DAY: ROLE REVERSAL. Over the last year, the S&P 500’s real estate sector ($IXRE—candlesticks) has been the worst sector performer and info tech (IXT—purple line) has been the best. This week, real estate is gaining and tech is losing ground. Data source: S&P Dow Jones Indices. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investUnrefreshing pause? As “pause” ideas build ahead of next week’s FOMC meeting, prepare for possible hawkish language as a side dish. Assuming the Fed does pause, it’s possible either the Fed’s statement or Fed Chairman Jerome Powell’s post-meeting press conference could include wording designed to stamp out expectations that a pause may lead to a cut. The fear of a rate-driven recession hasn’t vanished, even with recent talk on the financial networks about chances for a “soft landing.” While cyclical sectors like financials, materials, and industrials showed signs of emerging from slumber this week, possibly due to pause hopes, the same sectors could face a headwind if “Fedspeak” associated with the meeting takes a negative tone. We’ve seen many times when a Fed decision and statement initially send markets up before selling emerges during the Powell press conference.Summer breeze: So-called market “internals” improved recently, according to Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. That’s essentially the opposite of what we’ve seen most of the year in terms of metrics like stocks making 52-week highs and stocks trading at or above their respective 200-day moving averages. The more evidence of positive developments on this type of measure, the “healthier” the market will look. That could conceivably aid investor sentiment and provide a tailwind for sectors outside the info tech/communications services heavyweights driving most of this year’s rally. For this to happen, he says, would require less stress in the banking environment, a delayed start of the recession, and further clarity on the path of monetary policy.Sticker shock: One major inflation “driver” over the last two years is the automobile market. Potential car buyers received good news yesterday but it might not have much impact on Fed policy. The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index declined 2.7% month-over-month in May, following a 3% fall in April. Year-on-year, prices for used cars fell 7.6%—the biggest annual drop in four months, Trading Economics says. While this might play into next week’s inflation data, it’s likely not enough evidence of receding inflation to satisfy the Fed. Keep in mind that Fed is less concerned about goods inflation and more focused on a price measure known as Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) core services ex-housing, which strips out anything related to commodities, housing, and goods. Cars, obviously, are goods, not services—unless you decide to Uber.CalendarJune 9: No major earnings or data.June 12: No major earnings or dataJune 13: May Consumer Price Index (CPI), beginning of FOMC’s two-day meeting.June 14: FOMC rate decision and May Producer Price Index (PPI).June 15: May Retail Sales, May Industrial Production, June Empire State Manufacturing, and expected earnings from Kroger (KR). TD Ameritrade® commentary for educational purposes only.

US stocks are in the firing line if China’s economy stalls further Analysis by Nicole Goodkind, CNN Updated 10:35 AM EDT, Thu June 8, 2023 Link Copied! A version of this story first appeared in CNN Business’ Before the Bell newsletter. Not a subscriber? You can sign up right here. You can listen to an audio version of the newsletter by clicking the same link. New York CNN — Chinese economic activity has hit a soft spot in recent weeks and Hong Kong’s equity markets have flirted with bear territory as a result. That’s also bad news for US companies with major exposure to China — and a number of S&P 500 companies stand first in the line of fire if the situation worsens. What’s happening: China’s swift economic reopening in December after three years of severe pandemic restrictions was hailed as a catalyst that would send global growth into overdrive. Pent-up consumer demand and a resurgence of manufacturing by the world’s second-largest economy is expected to drive about 35% of the world’s growth in 2023, according to recent projections from the International Monetary Fund. China’s reopening has had positive effects: Factories had their best month in nearly 11 years in February and the country’s economy grew by 4.5% in the first quarter of the year. But recent data shows such positivity may have been short-lived. Chinese exports fell 7.5% year over year in May as global demand weakened. Recent data shows that China is also contending with worse-than-expected consumer spending, slowing manufacturing and weak home sales. Youth unemployment has hit 20% in urban areas, according to official data, a record high. Growing geopolitical tensions between Washington and Beijing have spooked investors, driving market volatility. A recent crackdown on American consulting companies like Bain, Capvision, Mintz Group and Micron Technology (MU) has worried multinational businesses, said US Ambassador to China Nicholas Burns on Wednesday. “Investor views about China remain pessimistic, partly because of skepticism about near-term growth momentum and partly because of worries about the longer-term outlook,” wrote Goldman Sachs analysts in a note on Tuesday. China, home to more than 1.4 billion people, saw its population drop in 2022 for the first time in more than 60 years. A shrinking population means lower consumption. When Beijing made the announcement in January, global stocks were roiled. The Dow fell by 300 points and the Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which follows Chinese firms on American exchanges, fell by 4%. What it means for markets: US-based companies doing business in China stand to lose if the economy continues on a downward trajectory. Companies like Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Ford (F) and Tesla (TSLA) have large manufacturing ties to the country. Others, like Starbucks (SBUX) and Nike (NKE), rely on Chinese consumers. Earlier this year, Bank of America (BAC) compiled a list of the S&P 500 companies with the highest exposure to China. Topping the list was Las Vegas Sands (LVS), down nearly 6% this month, with 68% of its sales coming from China. Qualcomm (QCOM), with a 67% exposure rate to China, issued disappointing forward guidance during earnings last month, citing China’s slow recovery. Tesla, Intel, Nvidia (NVDA), Wynn Resorts (WYNN) and MGM Resorts (MGM) were also among the 25 S&P 500 companies with the most exposure to China. Companies that generate more than 50% of sales outside of the United States saw an earnings decline rate of -10.2% in the first quarter of 2023, according to FactSet data. Companies that generated more than 50% of sales inside the United States, however, saw an earnings growth rate of 2.7%. Meanwhile, Chinese stocks trading in Hong Kong, just barely avoided entering bear territory this month: The Hang Seng index was down 19.6% on May 31 from its January high and the Golden Dragon China Index has fallen 5.6% so far this year. JD.com (JD), one of the largest Chinese companies trading in the United States, has fallen by nearly 36% this year. Morgan Stanley and Goldman Sachs Group have both lowered their forecasts for Chinese equity indexes. The bright side: There’s still potential for upside, say economists. Analysts at Nomura and Barclays forecast Chinese economic growth of almost 8% for the second quarter. Ayaz Ebrahim, JPMorgan Chase’s emerging markets and Asia Pacific equities portfolio manager, recently said on Bloomberg TV that the bank is adding more shares of Chinese stocks to its portfolio in a bet that the Chinese government will back floundering companies and boost valuations. Wildfires drive air purifier stocks higher Wildfires in Canada have smothered large swaths of the United States in a thick plume of toxic smoke, leading to air quality warnings and advisories to stay inside. But fine particles from the smoke can make their way indoors. Air purifiers can be helpful with filtering out the pollution. Searches on Google have increased 16 fold since Monday, according to Google trends. Whirlpool (WHR), one of the largest home goods manufacturers in the world, has seen its stock surge 13.2% over the past five days and by 6.4% on Wednesday alone. The company says that its HEPA purifiers can remove up to 99.97% of bad particles from air. Shares of Carrier Global (CARR), which makes residential and industrial air purifiers and HVAC units, have gained nearly 11% over the past five days. Johnson Controls (JCI), which has a number of air filters on the market, has also seen its stock price soar. Shares are up by 8.5% over a five-day period. The air purifier market is poised to grow as climate change increases air pollution and exacerbates breathing difficulties. A Market Insights report forecasts that the industry is expected to grow at an annual compound rate of 10.8% to $2.9 billion by 2025, and $4.8 billion by 2030. Outdoor air pollution could cause 6 to 9 million premature deaths a year globally by 2060 and cost $2.6 trillion annually because of sick days, increased medical bills and reduced productivity, according to an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development report. Diageo CEO dies at 63 after short illness Sir Ivan Menezes, who served for a decade as chief executive of the largest spirits maker in the world, has died at age 63 after a short but aggressive illness. Diageo confirmed Menezes’ death on Wednesday, just two days after the company announced that he was stepping down as CEO following complications from an emergency surgery on an ulcer. Menezes was born in 1959 in Pune, India. He held UK and US citizenship, as well as overseas citizenship for India. He joined Diageo at its creation in 1997 and became CEO in July 2013. He was knighted in January by King Charles III for services to Business and to Equality. Prior to his illness, he was expected to retire at the end of June. COO Debra Crew, who was set to become CEO on July 1, will take on the role of interim chief executive, effective immediately. Menezes, who ran the $93 billion company behind Johnnie Walker whiskey, Smirnoff vodka, Guinness and Tanqueray gin, was well known as a champion of diversity in the workplace. About 40% of Diageo’s senior positions are held by women and 37% of its leaders are ethnically diverse. “Ivan was undoubtedly one of the finest leaders of his generation,” said Diageo chairman Javier Ferrán in a statement on Wednesday. “Ivan was there at the creation of Diageo and over 25 years, shaped Diageo to become one of the best performing, most trusted and respected consumer companies.” Under his leadership, Diageo’s market value nearly doubled from $52 billion to $93 billion.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Better Buy: Apple vs. Amazon By Dani Cook – Jun 8, 2023 at 8:45AM Key Points Amazon and Apple shares both tumbled amid macroeconomic headwinds last year. However, Apple has rallied investors in 2023 with promising prospects in VR and AR. Meanwhile, Amazon has a lot to gain from a gradual easing of inflation. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These companies are excellent long-term options thanks to their solid positions in two crucial markets. After an economically challenging 2022, the stock market has been on a bull run this year. The Nasdaq Composite index has climbed 26% since Jan. 1 as easing inflation and technological advances have made investors bullish. However, many analysts believe the current optimism won't last forever, and the market will start trending down in the coming months as earnings slip from lingering macroeconomic hurdles. As a result, it's a good idea to use this time to invest in solid growth stocks that are likely to offer gains over the long term, no matter the economic climate. As the leaders of markets such as consumer electronics and e-commerce, Apple (AAPL 1.56%) and Amazon (AMZN 2.54%) are excellent options to fortify your portfolio in uncertain times. However, if you are only looking to add one stock right now, you'll need to know the better option. So, let's assess whether Apple or Amazon stock is the better buy. Apple Apple is a king in the consumer electronics market. The company has proved time and time again its ability to take existing technology and present it in a way that sends user adoption skyrocketing. Apple has done just this with smartphones, Bluetooth headphones, tablets, and smartwatches, achieving a leading market share in each of these sectors. The iPhone maker's dominance in consumer tech has seen its stock soar 272% in the last five years. As a result, the company's debut of a totally new product category at its Worldwide Developer Conference on June 5 makes for an exciting time to invest. Apple unveiled its Vision Pro virtual reality/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset at the event. The new device is essentially an entire computer in headset form, meaning it doesn't need to be paired to an external device like a smartphone or computer. The Vision Pro has taken massive leaps in VR/AR, removing the need for controllers by using advanced eye tracking and hand gestures. People can use the headset for nearly any computing task, from word processing to browsing the web, video editing, FaceTime, and much more. Additionally, the Vision Pro provides immersive entertainment experiences for everything from movies to gaming, watching sports, and more. While many tech enthusiasts are excited about the new product, Wall Street seems unsure what to make of it primarily because of its eye-watering price of about $3,500. The high price point means the Vision Pro is not accessible to the average consumer just yet. As a result, an investment in Apple is for what this product can become a few generations down the line when cheaper options become available to the masses. However, considering the AR market is projected to hit $461 billion at a compound annual growth rate of 42% through 2030, Apple is well-positioned to profit substantially from the expanding industry. Amazon Amazon shares have risen 49% year to date as its e-commerce business has shown signs of rebounding after significant losses last year. The company's e-commerce segments reported a combined $10.6 billion in operating losses in fiscal 2022 as economic declines curbed consumer spending. However, investors were able to breathe a sigh of relief in Amazon's first quarter of 2023, with its North American segment returning to profitability and its international retail business reporting a slight improvement. The retail giant looks to be back on a growth path as inflation eases, and it has more to gain than most as the situation improves. Amazon holds a leading 38% market share in e-commerce, which could lead to a massive boost in revenue as the market recovers. Meanwhile, improving interest rates will likely allow businesses to increase cloud spending, bolstering the company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services. Amazon's potential is evident in its average 12-month price target of $138, which projects stock growth of 10%. The figure aligns with the company's five-year stock gains of 48%, making Amazon an attractive long-term option. Is Apple or Amazon stock the better buy? The choice between Amazon or Apple stock comes down to which is the more reliable buy ahead of potential economic challenges. In this case, Apple is the clear winner. Amid a sell-off in 2022, Amazon's stock fell 50% while Apple's declined a more moderate 27%. The maker of MacBooks and iPhones is home to a more resilient business thanks to consistent product demand. Moreover, Apple's price-to-earnings ratio of 30 compared to Amazon's 299 makes its stock a far bigger bargain. So if you're looking for value and reliability in the retail sector, Apple's stock is an attractive option this month.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research 3 Nasdaq Stocks That Have Generated 10x Returns in 10 Years By David Jagielski – Jun 8, 2023 at 8:42AM Key Points Investing $10,000 into Apple, Nvidia, or Idexx Laboratories a decade ago would have netted you more than $100,000 today. Both Apple and Nvidia have some exciting next-gen growth opportunities to pursue that could ensure their businesses continue to grow in the years ahead. Idexx relies on more stable and consistent growth from a strong and resilient pet industry. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: IDXX Idexx Laboratories Market Cap $38B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.13%) $9.61 Current Price $460.48 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Have these stocks become too expensive to buy today? The Nasdaq is home to many of the best growth stocks in the world. Some of them have generated life-changing returns for investors, including Apple (AAPL 1.56%), Nvidia (NVDA 1.84%), and Idexx Laboratories (IDXX 2.13%). These stocks have all been 10-baggers over the past decade. Here's a closer look at these companies and whether they are still excellent investments today. 1. Apple In 10 years, shares of tech giant Apple have risen by more than 1,000%. If you'd invested only $10,000 in June 2013, it would be worth around $113,600 today. And that's investing at a time when Apple was already a big tech company known for its iPhones and growing ecosystem. Today, the company has a variety of different services, including music, streaming, books, news, and many others. Apple hasn't run out of ideas to grow, either. This month it unveiled Vision Pro, the company's augmented reality headset. Healthcare is another potential area of long-term growth for the business, as there have been rumors the company could be adding a blood glucose monitor on a future iteration of its Apple Watch. A company like Apple that gushes profits and free cash flow can afford to spend money on various ventures to see which one pays off. In the trailing 12 months, the company's free cash flow totaled more than $97 billion. That's why, despite being nearly worth $3 trillion, it may still not be too late to buy this behemoth, as Apple could have more growth opportunities to pursue in the future. At 28 times earnings, the growth stock isn't cheap -- but it's still not a big premium to own shares of a company that billionaire investor Warren Buffett says is ""probably the best business I know in the world."" 2. Nvidia Nvidia recently hit the $1 trillion valuation mark, as its stock has been rising sharply this year. Known for its video cards, Nvidia is a top name in computing, and the emergence of chatbot ChatGPT has only enhanced its popularity with investors. Artificial intelligence (AI) is the next new growth area for the business, with Nvidia recently launching an AI platform that it says offers ""full-stack innovation in computing, software, and AI models and services."" Nvidia's chips can also help companies build out their AI capabilities. The company forecast that for the current quarter (which ends in July), its sales will be around $11 billion -- smashing analyst expectations of $7.2 billion, leading to a rally in the stock's valuation. Demand has also been red hot for its data center products, fueling the company's strong numbers. Although its valuation has gone through the roof, with Nvidia's stock now trading at more than 80 times estimated future profits, it still has more upside to go as it promises to be a big name in AI. In 10 years, its shares have jumped by more than 10,000%, and a $10,000 investment a decade ago would be worth close to $1.1 million today. And remarkably, it may still make for a great long-term buy right now. 3. Idexx Laboratories Pet healthcare company Idexx Laboratories has given back some gains over the past few years, but its 10-year returns sit at just over 1,000%. A $10,000 investment in the stock a decade ago would now be worth around $107,000. The company has customers in over 175 countries, giving the business plenty of growth opportunities. Unlike the fast-growing tech and consumer stocks up higher on this list, Idexx's growth has been more constant and steady over the years: IDXX Revenue (Annual) data by YCharts. In 2023, for example, it's projecting revenue growth between 7.5% and 10%. On the bottom line, however, it's projecting up to 22% growth in earnings per share. The bulk of the company's revenue (approximately 92%) comes from the companion animal group segment, which includes veterinarian diagnostics products and services for pets. It also generates revenue from water testing products and livestock and poultry diagnostics. Spending on pets has risen over the years, ensuring demand for Idexx's products and services continues to increase. According to the American Pet Products Association, the U.S. pet market was worth $136.8 billion in 2022, representing a 51% increase from $90.5 billion in 2018. And this year it expects the market to rise to a value of $143.6 billion. With more spending still on the way, Idexx's business will remain strong. One obstacle that may keep investors from buying shares of Idexx, however, is the stock's hefty earnings multiple of around 60. Given the more modest growth opportunities in this industry, it may be hard to justify such a valuation for Idexx. David Jagielski has no position in any of the stocks mentioned.

Airbnb is keeping pace with change in its industry, and results are soaring. Apple's flagship products continue to flourish, and it recently unveiled its Vision Pro. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: ABNB Airbnb Market Cap $79B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (5.71%) $6.73 Current Price $124.59 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More These highly profitable growth stocks are just getting started. The market has already delivered its fair share of great and not-so-great days in 2023, but wonderful businesses are still showing investors that they have what it takes to win over the long run. It's important to remember that the share price of any given stock reflects how the market values it in a given moment. Share price can tell you a lot, but it doesn't tell you everything. Looking beyond share price at the underlying business and its core financials is how you discern whether you're looking at a great company with a clear path to growth ahead. If you're seeking two quality businesses that continue to deliver growth and profitability even in the current economy, you don't have to search far. Here are two household names that may be too good to pass up right now. 1. Airbnb Airbnb (ABNB 5.71%) has made a name for itself in the highly competitive yet fragmented travel industry, an effort that was by no means guaranteed success. However, in the roughly 15 years since Airbnb was founded as a small bed and breakfast in a living room in San Francisco, the company has evolved to such a scale that its platform captures roughly 20% of the entire vacation rental industry globally. Of course, Airbnbs today are used for far more than just short-term trips or leisure travel. People are staying in Airbnbs for longer periods and even living in these accommodations in some cases. As of the first quarter of 2023, guest reservations generated more than $20 billion in gross booking value. Almost half of all gross bookings were for stays of at least seven nights, while 18% of stays were long-term stays of 28 days or longer. That long-term stay figure was a slight deceleration from prior quarters, which was something management had predicted given the overall recovery in short-term stays now that borders have reopened after pandemic lockdowns. CEO Brian Chesky added some context to these developments in the company's first quarter earnings call: I do think there is some -- little bit of a post-pandemic equilibrium that you're starting to see, and we're also seeing a mix shift because cross-border urban nights are now up. That being said, I remain extremely bullish on long-term stays. I think this is going to be one of the big growth opportunities for Airbnb over the next five years. And the reason why is because people are permanently more flexible. Chesky also noted that one of the most prominent comments from users on the platform was about the cost of the long-term stays. The company has made more than a dozen upgrades to this travel segment in response, such as an automatic fee reduction for long-term bookings of more than three months. Guests can use buy now, pay later service Klarna when making reservations to reduce the upfront cost of a wide range of stay types. Airbnb also just launched an initiative called Airbnb Rooms, offering a new cost-effective category of accommodations where more than 80% of stays are less than $100 per night. Travel patterns have changed from the pre-pandemic era. Airbnb is continuing to demonstrate that it can efficiently (and profitably) adapt its business to cater to the changing needs of all kinds of travelers. Its cost-effective business structure remains remarkably asset-light because it connects travelers with hosts without needing to own or manage the actual properties. Investors might want to consider even a modest position in this resilient business. 2. Apple Apple (AAPL 1.56%) is hardly a new name to readers, but sometimes it's those tried-and-true businesses that investors will keep coming back to again and again. The tech behemoth, like other companies in its industry, is facing a challenging time as consumer spending patterns shift from goods to experiences and fears of a recession are still a potent reality. Although Apple's business covers a wide range of products and services, it still generates the lion's share of sales from its iPhones. Still, in the company's second quarter of its fiscal 2023, ended April 1, the company set a new record for iPhone sales, even as the difficulties of the current operating environment pushed overall net sales down slightly from one year ago. Another segment that continues to account for more and more of Apple's top line is its non-hardware services business. This includes subscriptions such as Apple Music and Apple TV+. It also covers products like Apple Pay, Apple Card, and even its newer buy now, pay later service. In the quarter, Apple brought in total net sales of $95 billion and net income of $24 billion. Of that total, $51 billion came from iPhone sales and $21 billion from its services business. Considering that Apple's services business is its most asset-light segment (its cost of sales was a mere $6 billion in the quarter compared to the $47 billion incurred from the products businesses), shareholders should watch the consistent headway this segment is making as the company's second-largest driver of sales. Apple is also making progress with its much-awaited Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which just debuted at the Worldwide Developers Conference and is expected to be released next year. The headset is expected to cost $3,499 a unit. It's likely to span a range of personal as well as professional use cases, integrating with other Apple products as well as a range of third-party apps. Apple just boosted its dividend by 4%, its 11th consecutive year of increasing its payout. It also returned a whopping $23 billion and some change to shareholders in the form of dividends in the March quarter. Even though the stock's dividend yield is less than 1% at the time of this writing, Apple's low payout ratio and consistent payout increases have made it popular with many income investors. Apple continues to demonstrate its relevancy and staying power with consumers amid the new waves of the digital age. For long-term shareholders, this is a business you can buy and hold on to forever.

The US stock market is unusually top heavy. Just two stocks, Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, account for nearly 15 percent of the S&P 500 Index. Add smaller but still formidable giants Amazon.com Inc, Alphabet Inc and Nvidia Corp, and that number climbs to 24 percent. That’s the highest concentration in the index’s top five holdings since at least 1990.One reason investors buy the broad market is to diversify the risk of owning too few stocks. But with five of them dominating the S&P 500, some investors may be wondering if buying a broad market index is too dicey. The short answer is that shifts in the index’s concentration don’t necessarily make it any more or less risky. In fact, it’s more likely the opposite — that those changes help stabilize the risk of investing over time.The longer answer lies in the way the S&P 500 is constructed. The index assigns weights to its constituents based on their market value so that more valuable companies receive a higher allocation than less valuable ones. That approach to weighting keeps a lid on risk because companies with larger market values tend to be safer than smaller ones — and as companies’ market value changes over time, their weighting in the S&P 500 goes up or down, leaving the overall risk of the index roughly unchanged.In 1990, for example, International Business Machines Corp. was the leading technology company in the world and Apple was an aspiring competitor, which is why IBM held the top spot in the S&P 500 and Apple ranked 107. Now the tables have turned, and so have the two companies’ ranks in the S&P 500, with Apple perched at the top and IBM demoted to 61, a risk adjustment that required no intervention from investors in the S&P 500.One way to see the relationship between risk and market value is to look at the interplay between market value and profits. The market famously prizes earnings above all else, not just because investing is a money-making endeavor but also because companies that make more money are generally sturdier businesses. Apple made $94 billion in net income during the past 12 months, while Fidelity National Information Services Inc., whose weight in the S&P 500 is a rounding error, lost more than $16 billion. It’s not hard to tell which company is the safer bet. Related stories Kerala Higher Education: The decline from meritocracy to mediocrity could soon become irreversibleRemote work pay cuts send the wrong messageECB inches nearer to the interest-rate summit The data show that market value and earnings power are closely, although not perfectly, related. The trailing 12-month net income of S&P 500 companies is strongly correlated with their market value (0.82) and weighting in the index (0.81). In other words, more often than not, the more money a company makes, the higher its market value and the larger its weighting in the S&P 500. (A correlation of 1 implies that two variables move perfectly in the same direction, whereas a correlation of negative 1 implies that two variables move perfectly in the opposite direction.)Not surprisingly, then, the S&P 500’s concentration would be roughly the same whether the index weighted companies by market value or net income, although the order of companies might differ. For instance, the top five stocks weighted by net income would account for 21 percent of the index, compared with 24 percent by market value; the top 50 would account for 57 percent of the index, the same percentage as by market value; and the top 100 by net income would account for 74 percent, modestly more than 71 percent by market value.The reason the S&P 500 is so concentrated is simply that a few companies are making a lot more money than everyone else. In 1990, the first year for which numbers are available, the top five companies in the S&P 500 accounted for 12.3 percent of the index and contributed 12.6 percent of total profits. Today’s top five contribute more than that to total profits, which is also why they occupy more of the index.The S&P 500 would almost certainly be riskier if it didn’t favor more valuable companies. The S&P 500 Equal Weight Index, which weights S&P 500 companies equally rather than by market value, has been 10 percent more volatile than the traditional S&P 500, as measured by annualized standard deviation since 1990. The equal weight index has also been more volatile than the traditional S&P 500 90 percent of the time over rolling three-year periods, with all the exceptions clustered around the peak and subsequent crash of the dot-com bubble.With renewed frenzy around technology, most recently artificial intelligence, one might conclude that the equal weight index is indeed safer. But the problem with the dot-com era was that stock valuations were stretched beyond reason, not that the market was too concentrated. The top five stocks in the S&P 500 at the peak of dot-com mania in 1999 accounted for about 16 percent of the index, which is not much higher than the historical average.That’s not to say the S&P 500 is risk free. On the contrary, the index is regularly in the path of crises and manias that temporarily shave off a quarter to half of its value. And concentration aside, history shows that some or all of today’s big five are unlikely to remain there in a decade or two. Through it all, however, the S&P 500 has returned about 10% a year over the long term, making it one of the most lucrative investments around.Think of the S&P 500 and other indexes weighted by market value as constantly rejiggering their lineup to balance risk — and be thankful for one less thing investors have to worry about.Nir Kaissar is a Bloomberg Opinion columnist covering markets. Views are personal and do not represent the stand of this publication.Credit: Bloomberg           Check your money calendar for 2023-24 here and keep your date with your investments, taxes, bills, and all things money.

Industries like electric vehicles and artificial intelligence have the potential to create incredible value. Four stocks in particular could be among the world's most valuable by 2040. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: TSLA Tesla Market Cap $792B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (2.22%) $5.43 Current Price $249.83 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Long-term investors might want to own a slice of these four powerhouse companies. Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the largest company in the world today with a $2.9 trillion market capitalization. Its stock went public in 1980, and it has since delivered a whopping return of 183,300% for investors. In dollar terms, an investment of $1,000 in Apple stock at its IPO would be worth over $1.8 million today! But it wasn't the first stock to have changed investors' lives over the long term, and it certainly won't be the last. So where will the next generation of market leaders come from? Companies developing electric vehicles (EVs), artificial intelligence (AI), and cybersecurity could be the best candidates. With that in mind, here are four stocks that fit the bill, and they could soar to become among the world's most valuable by 2040. 1. Tesla EVs are at the core of Tesla's (TSLA 2.22%) business; they account for the overwhelming majority of its revenue, and the company leads the industry in production and sales. It expects to produce 1.8 million cars in 2023, and CEO Elon Musk estimates that number could top 20 million by 2030. But EVs are also at the heart of what could be Tesla's most valuable long-term opportunity: its fully autonomous self-driving software. It is currently in live beta mode and has tested it over 150 million miles of road in the real world, with Elon Musk predicting it could be released publicly this year. By installing the software, a Tesla owner will be able to enroll a car as an autonomous robo-taxi within a ride-hailing network, where it will earn money during the hours it's not required for personal use. An estimate by Cathie Wood's Ark Investment thinks this could be a $4 trillion revenue opportunity by 2027, and it forms the basis of the firm's prediction that Tesla stock could soar almost 10-fold to $2,000 by then. Since competition is ramping up in the EV space, Tesla's leadership position in self-driving software could insulate it from an inevitable slowdown in sales over the long term, which is an attribute few other car companies will be able to match. Tesla is valued at $681 billion today, so if Ark's prediction comes true, the company will easily be one of the most valuable in the world by 2027, let alone 2040. 2. Palo Alto Networks Cybersecurity is quickly becoming one of the most crucial industries in the world. A broad range of estimates place the value of the sector's opportunity in the trillions of dollars; one calculation by research firm McKinsey & Company suggests organizations are already underinvested in cybersecurity by about $1.8 trillion. Palo Alto Networks (PANW 4.11%) is the world's most valuable cybersecurity company today with a market capitalization of $70 billion. The company claims to use AI to a greater extent than any of its competitors, and perhaps that's true given that it has the most comprehensive portfolio of cybersecurity products. It's working to embed AI into its three core segments: cloud security, network security, and security operations. Palo Alto's AI models already block 8.6 billion attacks on behalf of customers each day, the company says, which is a culmination of the learning achieved by ingesting 750 million data points every 24 hours. According to a survey conducted by global consulting firm PwC, one-quarter of top corporate executives think their businesses will be either highly or extremely vulnerable to cyber risks over the next five years. New advancements in AI could help plug complex vulnerabilities to give those CEOs more confidence, and that alone could usher in a new era of cybersecurity investment. Palo Alto stock just earned a place in the S&P 500 index, which validates its incredible rise to the top of its field over the last few years. Based on the growing need for cybersecurity, spending should easily run into the trillions of dollars by 2040, and this company is well-positioned to remain at the front of the pack. 3. Nvidia Since hitting a 52-week low of $108 just eight months ago, shares of Nvidia (NVDA 1.84%) have surged 262%. The company's dominant leadership position in the artificial intelligence space is at the core of that move, and it's really starting to transform its financial results. Nvidia is a semiconductor company, and it makes the most powerful data-center chips in the industry for training AI models like OpenAI's ChatGPT. It has a whopping 90% market share in that specific segment, and the company recently said there's $1 trillion worth of data center infrastructure that needs upgrading to support accelerated computing and AI. That's a seismic opportunity for Nvidia to have almost entirely to itself (for now). In its recent financial report for the fiscal 2024 first quarter (ended April 30), Nvidia not only crushed Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines, but it also issued revised revenue guidance for the second quarter that was $4 billion higher than any prior estimates. But here's the kicker: This wave of AI-driven value creation might just be getting started. Ark Investment Management thinks the technology will create $90 trillion in enterprise value by 2030, and add $200 trillion to global economic output thanks to immense gains in productivity. Nvidia is already the sixth-largest company in the world, and that could be the floor because the sky's the limit when it comes to 2040. 4. Amazon Amazon (AMZN 2.54%) is the undisputed global leader in e-commerce and cloud computing services, but it also has a formidable presence in other industries like robotics, digital advertising, and -- of course -- artificial intelligence. Amazon is worth $1.2 trillion today, which makes it the fifth-largest company in the world, and I'm suggesting it will at least hold that position thanks to its operational diversity. The company generated $220 billion in online sales in 2022, but a peek behind the curtain of that operation reveals an even more exciting opportunity. It has over 520,000 autonomous robots zipping around its fulfillment centers, and thanks to technological advances, they are now 2.5 times more efficient than human workers at picking and packing products. Amazon doesn't sell its robots to third parties yet, but it's worthwhile noting that the industry could be worth $9 trillion by 2030 (according to Ark Invest). Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the company's cloud segment, and it's the point of focus for investors because it's the primary source of the company's overall profitability. AWS offers a broader portfolio of solutions and generates more revenue than any of its competitors. Plus, it's one of Nvidia's oldest data-center customers, and it's rapidly becoming a key distributor of AI. AWS is set to launch its new EC2 P5 cloud instances, which will enable customers to seamlessly scale from 10,000 GPU chips to 20,000. The supercomputer-like performance will help them train larger language models than ever before, in addition to AI applications in general. I think Amazon has a clear pathway to a $5 trillion valuation over the next 10 years, which should solidify its place as one of the world's largest companies by 2040.

Apple's recently unveiled headset has taken leaps in VR innovation. Meanwhile, AMD has much to gain from supplying its chips to the market. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AMD Advanced Micro Devices Market Cap $208B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (3.42%) $4.27 Current Price $129.19 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More These companies have massive potential in the quickly growing $17 billion industry. Recent technological advances shed light on virtual reality (VR) in recent months, making it an industry worth keeping a close eye on. Meta Platforms and Sony have dominated the VR space with their respective headsets for years. But despite the stature of these companies, consumer adoption has been slow, with gamers seemingly the only group of shoppers with a strong interest in the technology. Meta has pivoted its business almost completely toward VR development and the metaverse. Yet, the company has had little success there. However, the sector could receive a massive boost now that Apple (AAPL 1.56%) entered the picture with its recently announced VR/AR headset, the Vision Pro. The company's history of success in new markets is immensely promising for the potential of its new headset and could spark a boom in the industry from the competition. Tech companies looking to expand their VR departments will likely turn to chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (AMD 3.42%), making it another great stock to keep on your radar. Here's a look at each of these virtual reality stocks. 1. Apple On June 5, Apple unveiled the Vision Pro at its Worldwide Developer Conference. The headset marked the debut of a new product category for the company, something that hasn't happened since the release of the Apple Watch in 2016. The Vision Pro has taken a massive step forward in VR, with features never before seen in competing headsets. The device is a full-fledged computer in a headset casing, granting it all the productivity and entertainment capabilities of a MacBook. Meanwhile, it has removed the need for controllers required in headsets from Sony and Meta by utilizing eye tracking and hand gestures. While Apple has given a glimpse of how VR can be incorporated into one's everyday life, the Vision Pro's starting price of $3,500 makes it challenging to get the headset into the hands of the average consumer. As a result, an investment in Apple is for its long-term potential in the sector. Future iterations of the Vision Pro will likely offer more palatable pricing, a strategy the company followed with past first-generation products. For instance, the base model Apple Watch's launch price started between $349 to $399, depending on size. These figures would equate to $430 and $490 today. Meanwhile, today's lowest-priced model comes in at $249 for the Apple Watch SE. The Vision Pro could see a similar trajectory regarding its pricing and product variations. The VR market is expected to hit a value of $227 billion by 2029, expanding at a compound annual growth rate of 45%, according to Fortune Business Insights. Apple's dominance in consumer tech and brand loyalty strengthens its outlook in VR and makes its stock an attractive buy as the industry blossoms. 2. Advanced Micro Devices Apple's Vision Pro has upped the game in VR, using the same chip as the current MacBook Air. Comparatively, Meta's Oculus Quest Pro headset uses Qualcomm's Snapdragon XR2 chip, based on the Snapdragon 865 used in premium smartphones in 2020. As a result, Apple has essentially made its headset a full-on computer, while its biggest competitor's equivalent product has the power of a three-year-old smartphone. The discrepancy will likely motivate companies to up their game, as Apple has set a new standard for the industry. Cue Advanced Micro Devices. AMD is a leader in custom chips, powering a number of devices across tech. The company is the exclusive supplier of graphics and processing power in Sony's PlayStation and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S game consoles, which has boosted its gaming segment in recent years. The lucrative partnerships led AMD to provide custom chips to a growing number of handheld PC gaming devices as well, as the company becomes the go-to for such hardware. VR headset makers like Meta will be on the hunt for more powerful chips for the next generation of their devices if they want to compete with Apple, and AMD is well-positioned as the clear choice. The company's chips are capable of running intensive VR and AR workloads, indicating it could significantly profit from the market's development. Moreover, AMD's price/earnings-to-growth ratio of 0.2 strengthens the argument for its stock. The figure suggests that projected growth is not priced into its shares, making it a bargain compared to its potential. And with that, AMD stock is an excellent option to invest in the swiftly growing VR market.

Learn More Meta Systems, Apple, and Unity Software could all be great long-term plays in this growing market. As the PC and mobile markets mature, many growth-oriented investors are looking toward the metaverse as the next big computing platform. The term -- and the concept behind it -- came from Neal Stephenson's 1992 sci-fi bestseller Snow Crash, but it only gained more mainstream attention over the past few years as more advanced virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) headsets hit the market. The bulls believe the metaverse will eventually blur the lines between the physical and digital worlds by enhancing real-world environments with digital overlays, virtually transporting people to both imaginary places and digital twins of real-world locations, and enabling people to remotely interact with each other without PCs or smartphones. It could also revolutionize video games by replacing monitors, TVs, consoles, and controllers with mixed-reality headsets. Image source: Apple. According to a recent report by Markets and Markets, the metaverse market could grow from $61.8 billion in 2022 to $426.9 billion by 2027 -- a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 47.2%. We should take that bullish forecast with a grain of salt, but these three tech giants -- Meta Platforms (META 2.30%), Apple (AAPL 1.56%), and Unity Software (U -0.85%) -- could profit from the market's secular expansion. Let's see what makes these three stocks potential buys this month. 1. Meta Platforms In October 2021, Facebook rebranded itself as Meta Platforms to emphasize its plan to evolve from a social media company into a metaverse one. It wants to achieve that transformation by expanding its Reality Labs division, which houses its VR and AR hardware and software, regardless of the near-term costs. Meta recently said that it sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets over the past four years. But from 2019 to 2022, the Reality Labs unit only generated $6.07 billion in cumulative revenues over those four years while racking up a cumulative operating loss of $35.03 billion. Meta expects the segment's annual operating losses to widen again this year as it launches its new Quest 3 headset this fall and ramps up its production of new AR and VR content. Those losses are staggering, but Meta remains firmly profitable because its core advertising business (which accounted for 97% of its revenue in 2022) still operates at high margins. That business is also gradually recovering from the user privacy improvements that Apple made to iOS (which disrupted platforms' ability to target ads to people) while countering TikTok's short videos with its own similar Reels. Meta still enjoys an early-mover advantage in the metaverse market, and the Quest 3's $499 price tag might make it the best option for consumers who don't want to spend thousands of dollars on a VR headset. That could also help tether more of the 3.81 billion people who use at least one of Meta's core apps (Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp) each month to its metaverse ecosystem. 2. Apple After years of rumors and speculation, Apple finally unveiled its new Vision Pro mixed-reality headset during its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. The Vision Pro is more technologically advanced than Meta's Quest 3, but it's priced accordingly at $3,499. It's scheduled to hit the market in early 2024 and will only initially be sold in the United States. The Vision Pro's high price tag could limit its appeal, but it could gradually diversify the tech giant's top line away from the iPhone -- which still accounted for 54% of its revenue in its latest quarter. It would also enable Apple to expand its subscription-based Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Arcade, and Apple Fitness+ services with AR and VR upgrades. Apple ended its latest quarter with 975 million paid subscriptions across that ecosystem, which represented 18% growth from a year earlier. By pulling some of those subscribers toward the Vision Pro and its mixed-reality apps, Apple could further strengthen the bonds between its hardware, software, and subscription-based services. It's well worth remembering that Apple didn't invent the MP3 player, the smartphone, the tablet computer, the smartwatch, or Bluetooth earbuds. But it disrupted all of those markets by studying the mistakes of the early movers, developing more appealing products, and tethering its devices to the rest of its prisoner-taking ecosystem. If the Vision Pro follows that same trajectory, it could eventually add tens of billions of dollars to Apple's annual revenue. 3. Unity Software Last but not least, Unity is my top pick-and-shovel play on the metaverse market. Its namesake game development engine already powers more than half of the world's mobile, PC, and console games, and many of the most popular VR games -- including Meta's Beat Saber and Population: One -- were created on its platform. That's why it wasn't surprising when Apple recently said it was working with Unity to create new apps for the Vision Pro. Unity's growth decelerated last year after Apple's privacy-oriented iOS update disrupted its ability to target the ads for its games. However, it bounced back from that setback by rewriting its own algorithms and merging with adtech company ironSource. As a result, it expects the growth of both its Grow (advertising and monetization) and Create (game development engine and non-gaming tools) units to accelerate again this year. Unity is certainly a more speculative play than Meta or Apple, but its revenue could surge as sales of new headsets drive more developers to create more metaverse apps.

By Leo Sun – Jun 8, 2023 at 5:58AM Key Points Unity's Q1 earnings report brought back the bulls. Its mixed-reality partnership with Apple amplified those gains. Its stock looks cheap relative to its expectations for 2024. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: U Unity Software Market Cap $14B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.85%) -$0.31 Current Price $35.99 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More The video game engine developer is overcoming its near-term challenges. Unity Software's (U -0.85%) stock price rallied about 35% over the past month on two positive developments. First, the video game engine developer posted better-than-expected first-quarter results on May 10 and raised its full-year guidance. Second, Apple (AAPL 1.56%) said it was working with Unity to develop mixed-reality apps for its new Vision Pro headset during its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 5. Those two developments brought some bulls back to Unity, but its stock remains 30% below its initial public offering price and more than 80% below its all-time high. Is it the right time to buy Unity as a turnaround play, or is it too late to hop on the bandwagon? Image source: Apple. Why did the bulls initially abandon Unity? Unity's game development engine is used to create more than half of the world's mobile, console, and PC games. It simplifies the entire process by bundling tools for creating graphics, sound effects, and other assets on a single platform. It also helps developers monetize their games with ads and in-game purchases. Unity initially impressed the bulls with its dazzling growth rates. Its revenue rose 43% in 2020, climbed 44% in 2021, and management claimed the company could maintain an annual growth rate of 30% over the ""long term."" But in 2022, its revenue only grew 25%. Unity's growth cooled off for two reasons. First, the video game market faced tough year-over-year comparisons against its pandemic-induced growth spurt throughout 2020 and 2021. Second, Apple's privacy changes on iOS disrupted Unity Ads' ability to craft targeted ads from third-party data. That disruption forced Unity to reboot its entire advertising business by rewriting its algorithms and merging with the adtech company ironSource last November. At its all-time high, Unity's enterprise value reached $56 billion, or 40 times the revenue it would generate in 2022. That bubbly valuation, along with its slowing sales growth and lack of profits, set it up for a steep drop when interest rates started rising last year. Will the latest news bring back the bulls? On a pro forma basis (including its merger with ironSource), Unity management expects revenue to rise 3% to 9% in 2023. It expects the company's top-line growth to stabilize this year as it reboots Unity Ads, benefits from China's recovery from the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, and gradually raises the prices for its paid tiers. It also expects its expansion into adjacent markets -- including digital twins and theatrical special effects (through its Weta Digital subsidiary) to bring in more revenue. Apple's new Vision Pro partnership with Unity could complement those plans. That deal isn't surprising, since its engine was already used to develop games for Meta Platforms' Quest headsets. But Apple might sell more headsets than Meta, which already sold nearly 20 million Quest headsets over the past four years, and drive more developers to use Unity to create mixed-reality apps. That growth could further diversify Unity's business away from mobile, console, and PC games. But with a hefty price tag of $3,499, Apple's Vision Pro could get off to a slow start when it launches in the U.S. in early 2024. Meta's new Quest 3 headset will only cost $499 when it arrives this fall. Therefore, investors who expect Apple's Vision Pro to boost Unity's near-term revenue will likely be disappointed. Investors should also recall that Unity operates a freemium platform, which tends to attract a lot of ""shovelware"" developers -- who ""shovel out"" low-quality apps without contributing any revenue. A lot of those shovelware developers could initially flock to the Vision Pro when it finally arrives. Will Unity's stock continue to rise? Unity currently has an enterprise value of $15 billion, or 7 times its projected revenue for 2023. That valuation is a bit high for a company that expects its revenue to only grow by the mid-single digits (on a pro forma basis) this year. But after lapping its merger with ironSource, analysts expect Unity's revenue to rise 19% in 2024 and 18% in 2025. Investors should take those estimates with a grain of salt, but they suggest it can overcome its near-term advertising issues and benefit from the long-term growth of the gaming, mixed-reality, digital twin, and theatrical effects markets. Unity also expects to generate $250 million to $300 million in adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) this year as it aggressively reins in its spending. That would mark its first positive annual adjusted EBITDA as a public company. It also believes it can generate a $1 billion adjusted EBITDA run rate by the end of 2024. Based on those longer-term estimates, Unity still seems reasonably valued at 6 times its 2024 revenue and 15 times its adjusted EBITDA. Therefore, if you believe Unity's business will continue to stabilize and expand, then it's not too late to buy its stock. Unity's insiders have also bought nearly 5 times as many shares as they sold over the past 12 months -- so brighter days might be ahead for this software company.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Wall Street Thinks This Stock Could Make Warren Buffett the Most Money Over the Next 12 Months By Keith Speights – Jun 8, 2023 at 5:52AM Key Points Some top contenders can be ruled out. One stock could make Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway close to $8 billion over the next 12 months if analysts are right. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: BAC Bank of America Market Cap $232B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (-0.48%) -$0.14 Current Price $29.13 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Analysts are especially bullish about this Buffett stock. Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A -0.36%) (BRK.B -0.50%) owns shares of nearly 50 stocks, but Warren Buffett didn't personally pick all of them. A few positions were initiated by Berkshire's investment managers. However, Buffett could profit from any of the stocks in Berkshire's portfolio. Some are likely to be much bigger winners than others. Wall Street thinks this stock could make Buffett the most money over the next 12 months. Ruling out some top contenders Before we get to that potential biggest moneymaker, let's rule out some of the top contenders. Analysts don't believe that several of the stocks many might guess would generate the biggest gains for Buffett will move the needle enough. For example, Apple (AAPL 1.56%) ranks as Berkshire's biggest single holding, by far. It wouldn't be surprising, therefore, if it made Buffett the most money over any given period. However, the consensus price target for Apple stock reflects an upside potential of less than 3%. Even the highly anticipated announcement of Apple's mixed-reality headset hasn't excited analysts enough to affect their price targets. What about Occidental Petroleum (OXY -0.22%)? Buffett is buying the oil stock more aggressively these days than any other. Berkshire now owns nearly 25% of Oxy. Wall Street is certainly bullish about Occidental. The average analyst's 12-month price target is roughly 17% above the current share price. But while an increase of that much would make Berkshire more than $2 billion in gains, Occidental still isn't the stock Wall Street has in mind. Take it to the bank I won't prolong the suspense. The one stock that Wall Street thinks will make Buffett the most money over the next 12 months is... Bank of America (BAC -0.48%). The consensus price target for Bank of America, Berkshire's second-largest position, reflects an upside potential of around 23%. With Berkshire's stake in BofA currently worth over $30 billion, a 23% increase would make the company nearly $7 billion. This amount, by the way, doesn't include any dividend income Berkshire should make with the bank stock. Bank of America currently pays an annualized dividend of $0.88 per share. Since it owns over 1.03 million shares, it stands to receive nearly $910 million in dividends over the next 12 months. Why are analysts so upbeat about Bank of America? One big reason is the stock is dirt cheap right now. After being hammered by the banking crisis earlier this year, BofA shares trade at a forward earnings multiple of below 8.4. But the bank's financial position remains strong. Its management team is top-notch and the company stands out as one of the leading technological innovators in the banking sector. Wall Street knows all of this. They realize that BofA's decline should only be a temporary one. Beyond 12 months Which stock is likely to make Buffett the most money over a longer period than 12 months -- say five to 10 years? Analysts won't help us with that question. However, I have a pretty good guess -- and I don't think it's Bank of America. I recently predicted that Amazon and Occidental will be Buffett's biggest winners this decade. Neither will be his biggest moneymaker, though. That honor will go to Apple, in my view. Berkshire's massive stake in Apple means that the stock doesn't have to move very much to generate a lot of money for the conglomerate. I'm optimistic about Apple's long-term growth prospects. Barring some dramatic change in Berkshire's stake in the company, I expect that Apple will easily be Buffett's biggest moneymaker over the next five to 10 years. But I agree with Wall Street about Bank of America. It probably will make the Oracle of Omaha the most money over the shorter term. And it could make investors who aren't multibillionaires money, as well. John Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research My Top 3 Dividend Stocks to Buy Now By Jeff Santoro – Jun 8, 2023 at 5:37AM Key Points Apple just released its Vision Pro, but that's not what investors should focus on. Costco's membership model helps drive growth in all economic conditions. Starbucks is finally seeing a turnaround in China, but the stock is still relatively cheap. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More A growing dividend and a track record of market-beating success has these stocks at the top of my buy list. Dividend stocks can be an important part of a well-diversified portfolio. This is especially true for investors who may be closer to retirement or have a lower tolerance for volatility and risk in the stock market. A steady income stream from dividend stocks could be precisely what some investors are seeking. That said, choosing dividend stocks can be tricky. Focusing on metrics like dividend yield alone could lead investors down the wrong path. Here are three stocks to buy right now that offer growth as well as a safe and reliable dividend. Apple Apple (AAPL 1.56%) has been in the news this week after the company announced its new Apple Vision Pro mixed-reality device at its developers conference. There will likely continue to be a buzz around this long-awaited device as the months pass before it's available to consumers. For investors, the impact may be even further away. The level to which this device becomes a revenue driver for the company is uncertain. Apple certainly has a track record of successful hardware launches, but there's no guarantee that will continue. Additionally, with a price tag of $3,499, it's likely that initial adoption will be slow. The important thing to watch for investors is how this device ultimately drives customers deeper into Apple's ecosystem of subscriptions as this is the highest-margin source of revenue for Apple. This segment accounts for 22% of total revenue, which is up from 19% three years ago. While Apple shareholders wait to see how successful this new product will be, they continue to benefit from the company's shareholder-friendly capital allocation strategy. Over the past 10 years, Apple has raised its dividend by 120% and lowered its shares outstanding by 38%. This makes Apple a compelling investment with or without a new hardware device. Costco As the third-largest retailer in the world, Costco Wholesale (COST 0.71%) is familiar to most consumers even if they're not members. It's also been a market-crushing investment over almost any time frame. Over the past 10 years, Costco's total return has been 477%, compared to the S&P 500's 222%. Over that same time frame, Costco has increased its dividend by 229%. In fact, since Costco first initiated its dividend in 2004, it has increased at a compound annual rate of 13%. There are many reasons for Costco's long-term success, but one unique aspect of its business model is its membership fees. Over the trailing 12 months, Costco has collected $4.4 billion in membership fees. While this accounts for less than 2% of total revenue, it's the catalyst that gets shoppers into the stores. At the end of the most recently reported quarter, the fiscal third quarter of 2023, Costco had 69,100 members and 124,700 cardholders. These metrics each grew by 7% compared to Q3 2022. Costco has faced some challenges recently but zoom out and the results are impressive. Consider Costco's revenue and net income over the very long term. COST Revenue (TTM) data by YCharts An important factor to consider when looking at this chart is that Costco succeeds even through recessions (the gray bars on the chart), showing the power of its value proposition to its members. This is worth considering if there is a recession in the coming months. Starbucks Starbucks (SBUX 0.51%) is another company with an impressive track record of market-beating performance and an increasing dividend. Over the past 10 years, it has outpaced the market's performance by nearly 62% and increased its dividend by 404%. Starbucks is a compelling stock to buy right now because the company is finally seeing a turnaround in its international business, which has struggled since the pandemic lockdowns, especially in China. In the second quarter of 2023, which ended in April, Starbucks' international revenue increased 9% year over year, driven by China's recovery. This is extremely important to Starbucks as China is the company's second-largest market after the U.S. The challenges Starbucks has faced in China over the last few years have dragged the stock price down. While it has recovered nicely in 2023, the current valuation is still on the inexpensive side relative to the historical average. Starbucks trades for 3.4 times sales, which is below the 10-year average of 4. The same is true for price-to-earnings ratio, which is currently 32, below the average of 68. There are brighter days ahead for Starbucks internationally, but the current price appears to still be carrying some of the residual effects of the last few years' challenges. This presents an opportunity for investors who are looking for a growth company that also has a growing dividend. Jeff Santoro has positions in Apple, Costco Wholesale, and Starbucks.

Two tech stocks, with very different growth trajectories, were aggressively bought by successful money managers in the March-ended quarter. Meanwhile, a perennial outperformer was put on the chopping block by multiple billionaire fund managers. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: INTC Intel Market Cap $138B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (5.52%) $1.73 Current Price $33.07 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Brand-name tech stocks were popular buys (and sells) among billionaire money managers during the first quarter. In case you haven't noticed, data releases are occurring all the time on Wall Street. From earnings reports to economic data, it's easy for investors to be overwhelmed and miss something important. A little over three weeks ago, there's a decent chance you missed one of those important announcements. May 15 marked deadline for institutional money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful fund managers bought and sold in the most recent quarter (in this instance, the March-ended quarter). Image source: Getty Images. As should come as no surprise, tech stocks were very much in focus -- especially among billionaire investors. Based on 13Fs, Wall Street billionaires piled into two large-cap tech stocks and avoided another widely held tech innovator like the plague during the first quarter. Large-cap tech stock No. 1 billionaire investors piled into: Intel The first big-name tech stock that Wall Street billionaires couldn't stop buying in the March-ended quarter is underperforming semiconductor company Intel (INTC 5.52%). All told, five billionaires were avid buyers, including: Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management Israel Englander of Millennium Management Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International Keeping this same order intact, these billionaires respectively purchased approximately 13.13 million shares, 10.4 million shares, 7.69 million shares, 1.99 million shares, and 1.2 million shares of Intel stock. What makes these purchases so intriguing is that they occurred during Intel's worst quarter in its storied history. The company lost $2.76 billion and saw revenue for its core client computing group and data center and AI (artificial intelligence) segments fall by 38% and 39%, respectively, from the prior-year period.  Normally, such poor performance would chase prospective investors away. However, there looks to be genuine value here for those willing to be patient. For example, Intel is currently spending $20 billion to construct two chip fabrication plants in Ohio, which are slated to open sometime next year.  It's also in the process of acquiring Tower Semiconductor. When all of these actions are complete, Intel will be on track to potentially become the second-largest foundry service provider by 2030. Providing domestic businesses with an alternative to overseas chip fab should help Intel regain some of its luster. Something else to consider is that Intel's market share losses to chief rival Advanced Micro Devices aren't game-changing. Intel still controls the lion's share of central processing unit sales in personal computers and data centers. That's not going to change anytime soon, which is good news for Intel's top cash-flow-generating segments. Furthermore, Intel has a beast on its hands with autonomous driving solutions company Mobileye Global (MBLY -4.48%). Intel acquired Mobileye six years ago for a little north of $15 billion.  When it was spun-out in 2022, Intel retained a majority of the outstanding shares. Mobileye closed this past week with a market cap of nearly $35 billion and the company's sales are rapidly rising. Large-cap tech stock No. 2 billionaire investors piled into: Palo Alto Networks A second large-cap tech stock that select Wall Street billionaires absolutely piled into during the first quarter is cybersecurity company Palo Alto Networks (PANW 4.11%). Form 13Fs show there were three big buyers: Steven Cohen at Point72 Asset Management Ken Griffin at Citadel Advisors Chase Coleman at Tiger Global Management During the first quarter, Cohen, Griffin, and Coleman oversaw the respective purchase of roughly 571,400 shares, 355,100 shares, and 257,700 shares of Palo Alto Networks' stock. Unlike the buying activity with Intel, which doesn't make sense unless you do some digging, it's crystal clear why billionaires are lapping up shares of Palo Alto. Next-generation security annual recurring revenue surged 60% in the latest quarter from the prior-year period, with total remaining performance obligations (i.e., the company's backlog) rising 35% to $9.2 billion.  In short, the company is firing on all cylinders. Ever since management made the decision nearly five years ago to shift the company's focus to cloud-based software-as-a-service (SaaS) subscriptions, Palo Alto has been virtually unstoppable. These higher-margin subscriptions now account for about 79% of net sales.  More importantly, SaaS is helping to court larger customers that are more willing to add to their initial purchase. Add-on sales with its next-gen solutions are critical to boosting the company's subscription gross margin. As I've stated in the past, Palo Alto Networks has also done a phenomenal job of incorporating inorganic growth into the mix. Bolt-on acquisitions have given the company a means to expand its product offerings and appeal to a broader swath of businesses. Lastly, cybersecurity can be considered a basic necessity service. Even though tech stocks tend to be cyclical, businesses are migrating their data online and into the cloud at a faster pace than ever before. Since hackers don't take time off from trying to steal sensitive information, the need for cybersecurity solutions tends to be a constant in any economic environment. Image source: Getty Images. The large-cap tech stock billionaires wanted nothing to do with: Apple However, it wasn't only buying on billionaires' minds during the first quarter. America's largest public company by market cap, Apple (AAPL 1.56%), was given the heave-ho by a number of successful fund managers, including: Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors Israel Englander of Millennium Management Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International In the order listed above, these five billionaires respectively dumped 7.52 million shares, 7.09 million shares, 5.12 million shares, 2.22 million shares, and 1.1 million shares of Apple stock. If you're wondering why billionaires are avoiding Apple like the plague, it may have to do with the company's valuation. Between the start of 2013 and end of 2018, you could nab shares of Apple for 10 to 15 times earnings. Best of all, it was consistently growing by a low double-digit rate. Today, you'll be paying about 30 times Wall Street's consensus earnings for Apple in fiscal 2023 (Apple's fiscal year ends in late September). While some investors might argue that a multiple of 30 isn't egregious for an industry leader like Apple, consider that its sales are expected to decline by nearly 3% in fiscal 2023, even with historically high inflation as a tailwind. Further, rapidly rising interest rates have removed access to cheap capital, which has the potential to slow Apple's pace of stock buybacks. The other possible knock with Apple is that it simply didn't do enough with iPhone 14 to differentiate it from previous 5G-capable models. Make no mistake, sales of the iPhone still dominate the U.S. smartphone market. However, there had been talk about expanding iPhone production in September of last year, which ultimately fell through after iPhone 14's relatively subdued launch. On the other hand, Apple is still a cash cow. It generated almost $110 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period, and has repurchased a jaw-dropping $586 billion worth of its common stock over the past 10 years. As a long-term business, Apple is rock-solid. But from an investment standpoint right now, it's difficult to justify its current valuation, especially with sales and profits contracting.

Got it!Share to FacebookShare to TwitterShare to LinkedinThe technology sector has been outperforming the averages for several months now. A breather is overdue. But that could be just the chance for investors to get on board! Here are three picks from three different MoneyShow contributors for this thriving, tech-driven market. Paul Dykewicz, StockInvestor.com Our team has identified five cutting-edge software investments to buy as technology rises again. The list features three funds, a cybersecurity company, and another primed to grow from artificial intelligence and automation. First Trust NASDAQ Technology Dividend Index Fund (TDIV TDIV ) is one of the diversified names. We’re showcasing investments that have been climbing as technology stocks recover from a plunge of more than 30% in 2022. Investors who don’t mind volatility may be able to outperform the market by taking the ups and downs of technology stock investing in stride to pursuit potentially strong returns in 2023. A broader-based tech fund with a higher dividend yield is TDIV. The ETF tries to track the Nasdaq Technology Dividend Index, which is composed of technology and telecommunications companies.TDIV Tickerstockcharts.com The fund recently had 94 holdings, and its 10 largest positions accounted for 59% of its assets. The biggest weightings were Microsoft MSFT (MSFT), Apple AAPL (AAPL), Intel INTC (INTC), Broadcom AVGO (AGVO VO ) and IBM (IBM IBM ). Roughly 13% of the fund was in communication services and the rest fit into the technology sector. MORE FROMFORBES ADVISORBest Travel Insurance CompaniesByAmy DaniseEditorBest Covid-19 Travel Insurance PlansByAmy DaniseEditor Recommended Action: Buy TDIV Hilary Kramer, GameChangers We rarely get much of a chance to talk about it, but momentum in the market works like physics. Any stock in motion will continue moving along that trajectory until some outside force gets in its way. Palantir Technologies PLTR (PLTR) is a name that has shot into the scoring zone. Most of our stocks reported good enough operational performance in the last few works to start moving toward the upside . . . some faster than others, but generally the right direction. Positions we were holding before they reported their quarterly numbers have rallied an average of 14.3% since. That’s pretty good. When you consider that the S&P 500 is down a fraction since the start of earnings season, it’s exceptional. What we’re left with is a generally warm vibe. A lot of people on Wall Street underestimated these companies. Estimates were too low, which means that now price targets need to rise in order to make the models match reality. After all, while everyone is entitled to an opinion on where the numbers are going, the magic of earnings season means that once the quarterly report comes out, there’s no more debate on how the numbers have stacked up. And once you accumulate enough data points pointing in one direction (UP), it gets really hard to argue that they “should be” going the other way. Most of our data points have pointed up this season, forcing stubborn investors and analysts to concede that they were wrong and that these companies are worth buying at this price. The machine-learning software and data-mining specialist PLTR in particular has been a revelation. Palantir Technologies (PLTR)PLTR chartquotemedia That stock had been left for dead before earnings proved that last quarter’s promises were more than a mirage. On the eve of its quarterly report, it had relapsed to $7.74. Here we are now, back above $12 and even $13.50 where the action gets especially intense. There’s absolutely nothing stopping PLTR from continuing to do well. I’d be inclined to see how far it can reach back toward what’s now the 2022 ceiling. Remember, we weren’t in the grip of zero-rate Fed mania then. That was close to the depth of bear market misery. And even then, PLTR managed to trade close to $15 before starting its long dreadful slide. That’s the kind of scenario I want to reach toward as the bull recovers. And it means that PLTR is a gift at this price. Recommended Action: Buy PLTR. George Gilder, Gilder’s Moonshots SkyWater Technology (SKYT) specializes in helping its customers develop and then manufacture customized integrated circuit devices. Setting the company apart is a trifecta of differentiation. For starters, it’s the only US-based and solely US-owned pure-play semiconductor foundry. Then there is SkyWater’s portfolio of specialized wafer fabrication processes including mixed-signal CMOS, rad-hard ICs, power discretes, MEMS (microelectromechanical systems), superconducting ICs, photonics, carbon nanotubes, and others. Finally, the company’s novel customer engagement model, dubbed Technology as a Service (TaaS), enables innovative chip firms to co-create novel solutions across SkyWater’s technologies, diverse manufacturing capabilities, and design/production services. One innovator taking advantage of SkyWater’s Technology as a Service model is Weebit Nano. If that name sounds familiar, until a few months ago we held WBT WBT in the Special Situations Portfolio of the Gilder Technology Report. We got great results: The stock more than doubled in less than a year, meeting its total return target before we closed the position. You have not heard the last of Weebit, which makes an emergent form of nonvolatile memory called ReRAM (resistive random-access memory) that is enabling new applications from neuromorphic computing to industrial IoT. Weebit is one of more than a dozen breakthrough startup companies spun out of James Tour’s lab at Rice University. Yes, that’s another familiar name as we’ve written a great deal about Tour’s pioneering work in nanotechnology and graphene. Most of the Tour spinoffs are still privately held. One of the few publicly traded Tour spinoffs, WBT is on the Australian Stock Exchange. On the verge of generating revenue after years of R&D with the help of SkyWater, the company recently raised A$60 million of equity to continue development of its ReRAM technology. SkyWater’s engagement with ReRAM started with a collaboration on a carbon nanotube-based 3D project with MIT, funded through DARPA’s Electronics Resurgence Initiative. That work built the core competences underlying SkyWater’s development partnership with Weebit. ReRAM offers strategic advantages over currently dominant Flash memory including improved write time, endurance, cost-effectiveness, and power consumption. (See exhibit below.) It may seem counterintuitive that these specialized memory devices can undercut Flash on costs. This is thanks in part to the fact that ReRAM fabrication is highly complementary to SkyWater’s foundational CMOS platform. The fabrication of NAND Flash is a far more complex process.Weebit ChartWeebit Nano SKYT is one of the most exciting opportunities in the Moonshots portfolio. Its work to date confirms its great potential for growth. Recommended Action: Buy SKYT.

Do you feel lucky? Photo by Scott Gries/Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement AAPL +0.13% MSFT +0.82% AMZN +0.29% NVDA +1.36% GOOG +0.81% TSLA +1.70% META +1.16% SPX +0.50% SJIM -2.99% LJIM +2.92% VT +0.67% Jim Cramer, the famous stock jockey of CNBC, is mega bullish of what he calls the Magnificent Seven: The mega cap tech stocks Apple AAPL, +0.13%, Microsoft MSFT, +0.82%, Amazon AMZN, +0.29%, NVIDIA NVDA, +1.36%, Alphabet GOOG, +0.81%, Tesla TSLA, +1.70% and Meta META, +1.16%. “The Magnificent Seven are the real deal,” Cramer told Mad Money viewers on Thursday. “Seven brilliantly run companies, with amazing sales and earnings. Great balance sheets. So what if they lead the way? I mean, a win’s a win.” Cramer is so bullish on these stocks that Matt Tuttle, who runs a mutual fund that bets on Cramer’s picks, tells me that after Thursday’s program he decided to move 50% of the fund’s entire holdings into those seven stocks. And meanwhile Tuttle is moving 50% of another fund, which bets against Cramer’s picks, into “short” positions on the same seven stocks, meaning he is betting that they will go down. So far, so inside baseball. But here’s what most of the public don’t realize. Those seven stocks have now soared so high that they currently make up a staggering 27% of the entire S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% by market value. And that means they now make up 16% of a standard U.S. retirement portfolio, which is typically invested 60% in the S&P 500 and 40% U.S. bonds. If you own any kind of standard, benchmark or plain-vanilla retirement fund you are almost certainly heavily invested in seven sky-high stocks that Cramer loves. On average, you’re likely to have $1 of every $6 in them. Yikes! Or should I say, “booyah”? Is this a problem? As usual, it depends on who you ask. Many on Wall Street, and in the financial planning industry, will swear blind that the market is perfectly “efficient,” meaning share prices always make sense. Therefore, they argue, if these seven companies account for one-sixth of a balanced 60/40 portfolio then that’s perfectly sensible. Others will say that’s total rubbish. The question of Cramer is a thorny one. Cramer’s critics say he is often a reverse indicator, turning most bullish on a trend right at the peak and most bearish right at the bottom. The “curse of Cramer” is a running joke on Twitter. If he is now all-in on the booming Magnificent Seven, critics say, it’s time to start eyeing the exit. This is the rationale behind Tuttle’s Inverse Cramer Tracker ETF ( SJIM, -2.99% ). I asked CNBC if they, or Cramer, wanted to comment. They declined. But let me offer some defense. I actually like Cramer (despite, or maybe because, he once called me an idiot on NBC, in conversation with…Matt Lauer). I once worked for him at TheStreet, and had a fabulous time under the late, great editor Dave Morrow. Cramer gets a lot of criticism. But the problem isn’t that he does his job badly — it’s that he tries to do a job that is completely impossible. Every night he is picking stocks, offering fresh insight, and responding to an insane blizzard of viewers’ calls about their portfolio holdings. Nobody could do his job and beat the market. Nobody. Not Buffett. Not Renaissance’s Capital’s Jim Simons. Not the late Sir John Templeton. It’s amazing Cramer can do it at all. Dave Morrow, the late editor of TheStreet.com, once told me he couldn’t bear to watch more than about 10 minutes of the program at a time. Tuttle, who says he has been watching the program every night all year in order to monitor his funds’ portfolios, jokes: “I am doing long-term damage to my brain.”  The issue is that in the end Cramer becomes — unwittingly or not — a very powerful indicator of the “conventional wisdom” on Wall Street. It’s inevitable.  (It is noteworthy that when Cramer finally felt so despairing of the stock market that he went on The Daily Show and let himself be berated by Jon Stewart, it was early March, 2009—the exact bottom of the crash.) “Basically it’s a short-term momentum strategy, sometimes what’s strong continues to be strong for a while,” says Tuttle of Cramer’s stock picks, adding: “To his credit he has been on NVDA, META, AAPL all year.” And let the record show that since the launch in March, the fund that bets on Jim Cramer has done better than the fund that bets against him: The Long Cramer Tracker LJIM, +2.92% is up 3.2%, while Inverse Cramer is down 3.6%. But even putting Cramer’s bullishness aside, betting 16% of your retirement on seven companies makes no sense. It flouts basic common sense about diversification, if nothing else. It makes even less sense when those companies’ stocks are already expensive, and popular, and being chased to new highs by the hot money. Some numbers may put this in context. According to FactSet data, those seven companies in total are now valued at more than $10 trillion. Their stock market value is now more than twice the annual GDP of Japan. They have gained $3.6 trillion so far this year — which accounts for 85% of all the rise in the entire U.S. stock market, and more than half the total rise in the entire global stock market. They are valued, collectively, at about six times the next year’s expected revenues.  They now trade on an average of 30 times forecast per-share earnings of the next 12 months. That’s about twice the historic stock market average. These seven stocks also account for 23% of the total U.S. stock market by value, when you add in all the midsize and small companies as well as the S&P 500. And a slightly more sane 10% of the total global stock market. Make of this what you will. My own take is that at the bare minimum this insanity pretty much proves the case for holding a global stock portfolio, not merely one invested in the U.S. The truly basic, plain-vanilla 60/40 portfolio should be 60% in a global stock fund like Vanguard Total World Stock VT, +0.67%, not in the S&P 500 or even the total U.S. market. (Actually, I’d go even further in investing in non-U. S. stocks, but that’s another story.) As for the battle between the ETF that bets on Cramer and the ETF that bets against him? Stay tuned.

Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement AAPL +0.13% Soccer legend and newly minted World Cup champion Lionel Messi is set to join U.S. Major League Soccer’s Inter Miami CF next season, according to reports from the BBC’s Guillem Balague and soccer news-breaker Fabrizio Romano. The move for the Argentinian comes after months of speculation of which club he will play for after his eventual departure from France’s Paris Saint-Germain. Other teams reportedly interested in Messi were Barcelona FC and Saudi Arabia’s Al-Hilal. “If it had been a matter of money, I’d have gone to Arabia or elsewhere. It seemed like a lot of money to me”, Messi said in a Tuesday interview.  “The truth is that my final decision goes elsewhere and not because of money.” See also: LIV and PGA Tour merger: Phil Mickelson and Donald Trump are all ‘fore’ it Inter Miami is the 11th most valuable MLS club at $600 million, per Forbes, and is majority owned by Jorge Mas and soccer legend David Beckham is a co-owner. According to a report from The Athletic, Apple AAPL, +0.13%, which owns the global streaming rights to MLS games, has gotten “very creative” with discussions about a potential Messi move to the MLS. Apple has discussed offering Messi a share of the revenue generated from new subscribers to MLS Season Pass, the tech giant’s Apple TV+ product to watch games, according to sources briefed on the discussions. Apple also announced Tuesday that it is producing a documentary on Messi and his World Cup career that will debut on Apple TV+. That same Athletic report indicated that Adidas, who also sponsors Messi in addition to the MLS, has considered a similar revenue sharing agreement with the soccer star if he came to the MLS. Apple and Adidas did not respond to MarketWatch’s requests for comment on this story. It would be a major boost for American soccer, which has attracted superstars like Pele, Beckham and Thierry Henry over the years.  While the MLS is not considered a top soccer league in the world, trailing other historic entities including England’s Premier League, Germany’s Bundesliga, Spain’s La Liga, and Italy’s Serie A,  the MLS, founded in 1993, is one of the newer soccer leagues in the world. If the reports are accurate, Messi, would have turned down an offer from Al-Hilal that would have paid him roughly $428 million per season, the highest per season contract in the history of professional sports. Other top footballer Cristiano Ronaldo moved to Saudi club Al-Nassr this season for history-making $210 million per season. Messi is a seven-time Ballon d’Or winner, four-time Champions League winner, and 12-time domestic league champion and considered by many to be one of the greatest footballers of all time. Messi, 35, has a net worth in the hundreds of millions. Last year alone he made $130 million ($65 million in salary, $65 million in endorsements), according to Forbes estimates.

Network  June 7, 2023 11:42 AM |  8 min read Advertiser Disclosure(Wednesday market open) Stocks continue treading water near recent nine-month highs ahead of next week’s Federal Reserve meeting. It’s a quiet period with little economic data or earnings to propel things in any given direction.Major indexes recently bumped against areas of technical resistance on the charts and don’t seem in a big hurry to mount a test of those levels.The “easy” part of the long 2023 rally might be coming to an end. Until now, investors could almost count on a handful of heavyweight tech stocks driving up the value of major indexes.While there’s a chance that could continue, the dramatic gap between 30% year-to-date gains for the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 (NDX) and 11% gains for the S&P 500® Index suggests other sectors need to step up for the rally to achieve more street cred. The SPX wouldn’t be up at all this year if it weren’t for that same handful of tech stocks.The broader market appears to at least be stirring, with the critical financials sector up over the last week and the last month. Other cyclical sectors like energy, industrials, and materials that sat on the sidelines the last three months also flexed some muscle recently, though energy continues being dragged by a lackluster crude oil market. Consumer discretionary leads all sectors over the last five days and sits behind only info tech and communication services over the last month.Major U.S. indexes finished mostly higher Tuesday as small-cap stocks started to recoup some of the losses they suffered during the banking-sector turmoil back in March. The small-company-focused Russell 2000® (RUT) rose roughly 2.7% to a three-month high.Morning rush The 10-year Treasury note yield (TNX) was flat at 3.69%. The U.S. Dollar Index ($DXY) inched down to 103.89. The Cboe Volatility Index® (VIX) futures climbed just slightly to 14.06 and remain near three-year lows. WTI Crude Oil (/CL) rose to $72.47 per barrel. The benchmark 10-year Treasury yield had a volatile May, covering more than 50 basis points between its low near 3.3% and its high above 3.8%. The late May yield rally ultimately fizzled, though yesterday’s closing yield of 3.68% remained above the 200-day moving average of 3.63%. The moving average happens to sit near an interesting area on the chart at around 3.6% that’s served as support and resistance for months and bears continued monitoring for possible direction.Volatility remains extremely low at present, but Cboe futures for the coming months build in rising levels.Just inTreasury Secretary Janet Yellen said in an interview with CNBC this morning that bringing down inflation remains the top priority, but acknowledged potential issues within commercial real estate markets. She also sees a path to bringing down inflation while maintaining a strong labor market.Yellen added that the level of capital and liquidity in the banking system remains strong.What to WatchPerhaps you’ve noticed a lack of major layoff announcements lately after a flurry earlier this year from the tech sector. Though a few companies discussed job cuts during earnings season, job openings continue to grow and unemployment remains historically low under 4%. While no one wants people to lose jobs, this tight labor market could be one reason inflation remains a nagging issue, and tomorrow’s weekly initial jobless claims loom.Analysts expect claims of 237,000, up from 232,000 last week and near the higher end of the recent range. Claims are up this spring from historic lows below 200,000 earlier this year, but they aren’t near levels that suggest recession. The weekly tally would need to reach 300,000 to paint a truly bearish picture for the roaring labor market.Talking technicals: The 4,300 level remains a potential technical resistance spot for the SPX, and above that there’s believed to be technical resistance at last summer’s 4,325 high. Yesterday’s SPX close of 4,283 was the highest this year and since last August, but the info tech stocks that that got the SPX here aren’t sizzling like they did in late May.Stocks in the Spotlight(Almost) halfway home: It’s hard to fathom, but the year is nearly half over. Itching to know what the second half might hold for investors and the global markets? Schwab Chief Global Investment Strategist Jeffrey Kleintop thinks the coming six months may feature less drama but possibly milder returns for global stocks after their double-digit first-half gains. And a mild recession in corporate earnings could continue, he adds.Shares of crypto exchange platform company Coinbase (COIN) rebounded 4% in premarket trading a day after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) charged it with operating its platform as an unregistered national securities exchange, broker, and clearing agency. There’s an elevated amount of uncertainty in this space that could lead to more volatility in an already rocky area of the market.Eye on the FedChances of an interest rate pause at the June meeting stand at 77% this morning, according to the CME FedWatch tool, which also prices in a nearly 66% chance that rates will rise by July. These numbers haven’t moved much the last few days, reinforcing ideas that a pause is likely next week.The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting starts next Tuesday, the very day of the critical May Consumer Price Index (CPI) report. A Fed decision will be announced next Wednesday afternoon.With the meeting ahead and no major data on this week’s calendar, Treasury yields could trade in rangebound territory the next few days, says Collin Martin, director of fixed income strategy at the Schwab Center for Financial Research. CHART OF THE DAY: RUT BREAKS OUT. The Russell 2000 small-cap index (RUT—candlesticks) broke out of a long rut this week, posting three-month highs. It got a lot of help from a reviving banking sector (KRX—purple line), as the RUT is heavily exposed to financials. Data sources: Nasdaq, FTSE Russell. Chart source: The thinkorswim® platform. For illustrative purposes only. Past performance does not guarantee future results. Thinking capIdeas to mull as you trade or investExiting penalty box? As the so-called Magnificent Seven big-tech stocks continue to gallop, where could strength emerge beyond that small group? Some other sectors are stirring awake. Consumer discretionary and real estate were livelier last week, outperforming info tech. The small-cap Russell 2000 did well early this week and recently broke out of a long-term trading range where it had wallowed most of the year.  The financials sector—beaten down by bank failures earlier this year—rose about 1.5% over the last five trading days but remains down more than 5% year-to-date. The KBW Regional Banking Index (KRX) recently hit a six-week high as more signs of banking stability emerged. Credit markets are showing little signs of an economic slowdown and the corporate new issue market has picked up lately. One regional bank even issued debt—the first regional bank to do so since the early March bank failures.Seven Horsemen: The Magnificent Seven, by the way, are Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), and Microsoft (MSFT). Together, they account for about 30% of the SPX’s current market weight and are responsible for almost all SPX gains year-to-date. The term was coined by a Wall Street analyst, and the group includes all but one member of the previous high-net-worth club on Wall Street, the FAANGs. Missing is Netflix (NFLX), though shares of the streaming company are up sharply this year. With a market capitalization of under $200 billion, Netflix simply can’t compete for a place in the Seven with the nearly $1 trillion market-cap of Nvidia. The trouble with FAANG was its exclusion of Microsoft, which analysts often described as an “honorary FAANG.” There were other acronyms, too, like MANA (Microsoft, Apple, Netflix, and Alphabet), and BAT, which included a handful of Chinese tech stocks. Also, TINA (There Is No Alternative) became a popular way to describe stocks when rates were zero, but it exited stage Fed about a year ago.Price check: When the CPI and Producer Price Index (PPI) reports arrive next week, it’s important to focus on the month-over-month data. The year-over-year growth will likely be skewed by last June’s huge inflation jump. Comparisons to a year ago could be easier in June and continue that way at least through the end of this year, causing a discrepancy between annual and monthly inflation growth. The Fed’s annual inflation goal is 2%, and year-over-year numbers now above 4% could slip closer to 3% in coming months simply due to easier comparisons. However, if the monthly core CPI continues to grow by 0.4% or so, as it has most of this year, the Fed might not be done hiking. Many consumer-oriented companies said during earnings season that customers stayed resilient despite rising prices. There may be little keeping companies from ratcheting stickers higher until shoppers balk. That’s bad news if you’re a shopper but potentially good news if you’re an investor hoping for earnings growth through margin expansion. Net profit margin inched up to 11.5% in Q1 for S&P 500 companies, FactSet notes, from 11.3% in Q4. That’s still down from 12.2% a year earlier.CalendarJune 8: April Wholesale Inventories.June 9: No major earnings or data.June 12: No major earnings or dataJune 13: May Consumer Price Index (CPI), beginning of FOMC’s two-day meeting.June 14: FOMC rate decision and May Producer Price Index (PPI). Image sourced from ShutterstockThis post contains sponsored advertising content.

Facebook 0 Twitter 0 Pinterest 2 Mail 0 Are you searching for some of the best penny stocks to buy now? I’m sure that if you’re reading this article, that’s something at the top of your mind. But there’s more to it than just hunting for today’s top movers. Are you day trading? Are you swing trading? Has long-term investing in penny stocks become a recent focus? No matter which style of strategy you’re using, it’s essential to understand that risk and reward play an important role when we’re talking about penny stocks or stocks under $5. That’s thanks, in part, to the inherent volatility in this niche of stocks. Due to their low prices alone, even the slightest price change can equate to a significant percentage fluctuation. Yesterday we discussed penny stocks under $1. That subset of stocks in this niche can see a percentage change of 50% or more from just a drop of 50 cents or less. The same can’t be said for large company stocks like Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) or Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Regardless, the focus today is on cheap stocks, what’s happening in the stock market today, and if there are any potential opportunities to capitalize on. So where should you begin? The first step in finding the best penny stocks to buy is formulating a watch list. Some traders will focus strictly on technical analysis and momentum. High- and unusual-volume stocks are likely a point of interest. Others will look for something more fundamentally based, like company filings or corporate milestones. Today’s article looks at a list of penny stocks with big news this week. We dive into the details of these announcements and identify any upcoming events that could act as potential catalysts. You can then decide whether these are the best penny stocks to watch this week. Hot Penny Stocks Today Hyzon Motors (HYZN) Hyzon Motors is a supplier of zero-emission heavy-duty fuel cell electric vehicles. The company offers solutions in the transportation sector. Shares of HYZN stock slowly climbed back since reaching fresh 52-week lows last month. The drop came as Hyzon transitioned some of its leadership team, including its CEO and certain Board members. – 3 Penny Stocks Under $1 To Watch This Week; Time To Buy? HYZN Stock News This week HYZN stock caught a stronger surge of bullish sentiment thanks to a recent deal with Performance Food Group (NYSE: PFGC). The two agreed to five fuel-cell electric vehicles. Commenting on the milestone, Hyzon’s chief executive officer Parker Meeks said, “This agreement for up to 50 hydrogen-powered trucks demonstrates how Hyzon intends to build customer familiarity with a new technology as the hydrogen infrastructure accelerates.” TuSimple Holdings Inc. (TSP) Another one of the automotive tech stocks to watch this week after the news is TuSimple. The company builds autonomous driving technology platforms. It focuses on the automotive industry’s commercial portion and provides fully autonomous deriving solutions for long-haul heavy-duty trucks. TSP Stock News This week TuSimple announced that its autonomous trucks began testing in Japan. As of March, the company’s trucks have logged more than 10 million cumulative miles through testing, research, and freight delivery. Thanks to the driver shortage in Japan, TuSimple aims to tackle this problem head-on and could be a “promising solution,” accounting to CEO Cheng Lu. eFFECTOR Therapeutics (EFTR) We discussed eFFECTOR about a week ago in the article Stock Market Today: New Penny Stocks Trends & 3 To Watch This Week. One of the main highlights and why EFTR stock was on traders’ radars originated from a recently closed financing round. The cancer treatment company has been in the spotlight since the end of April after presenting positive data updates from Phase 2 expansion cohorts. – 4 Penny Stocks To Buy In June According To Insiders These evaluated its zotatifin in breast cancer patients. The findings showed that 5 of 19 patients treated demonstrated a partial response when combined with fulvestrant and abemaciclib. A partial response was also observed in 1 of 3 patients treated with zotatifin combined with fulvestrant. EFTR Stock News This week more funding news was announced, which seems to have been received relatively well by the stock market today. eFFECTOR announced an $8.7 million round priced at$1.125 per share. The offering is anticipated to close on June 8th, with proceeds intended for working capital, including funding R&D. Seres Therapeutics (MCRB) Another one of the biotech penny stocks to watch after news this week is Seres Therapeutics. The company specializes in microbiome treatments for serious diseases. Its lead program VOWST  aims to percent the recurrence of C. difficile infection and was granted FDA approval in the US this past April. MCRB Stock News This week, VOWST is back in the news. Seres and Nestlé Health Science announced the commercial availability in the U.S. Greg Behar, Chief Executive Officer of Nestlé Health Science, commented, “Since the approval of VOWST, our teams have engaged with healthcare professionals and are committed to facilitating patient access.” – Trading Penny Stocks for Income, Top Tips Freight Technologies (FRGT) Logistics technology company Freight Technologies saw some signs of recovery in the market for the first time in weeks. Shares have been in a slump since the company announced Q1 earnings. The maker of the Fr8App, a freight-matching platform powered by AI, has released news that sparked some bullishness in the stock market today. FRGT Stock News This week the company announced a new link up with Samsara, which is the maker of Connected Operations Cloud. Fr8App customers can now use insights from Samsara’s technology to optimize logistics operations and ensure delivery timeliness.

Δ Garrett Baldwin Dear Old Friend, First off, happy birthday to my father today… I’m sitting in a rundown hotel in Jamaica, New York City – waiting to catch my flight to Baltimore. What a stark difference from 24 hours ago. The air quality in Switzerland is immaculate, fresh, and inviting. In New York, smoke from Canadian wildfires blankets the East Coast. Instead of a red carpet, New York City rolled out an orange sky for me. Revisiting Our Conversation with Tim, Ben, and Joe. Two days ago, I introduced you to our friends Ben and Joe. But what I didn’t tell you… the two didn’t join us for drinks at Tim Melvin’s house. Tim and I discussed the academic writings of value-investing legends Joseph Piotroski and Ben Graham. We had literature on the table… There was a copy of Graham’s “The Intelligent Investor” and Piotroski’s “Value Investing: The Use of Historical Financial Statement Information to Separate Winners from Losers” in the Journal of Accounting Research. You can learn a lot by reading both and witnessing how their insight can work together to find successful investments. Right now, everyone is talking about Artificial Intelligence – despite their insanely high valuations and concerns about hype. Instead – we should be focusing on the things that we need. Tim constantly notes that it’s BORING to buy the stuff we need in this world, right? Energy, food, housing, airlines? Defense? That’s interesting – because we’re already experiencing one of the worst droughts in decades. DECADES. The U.S. corn crop quality plunged last week in the USDA quality report. But you don’t see many people talking about it because it’s food. It’s boring. But Tim always stresses a vital lesson: Boring is better… Boring can provide us with the best investment strategy in the market. And that’s not me saying this. It’s been confirmed by academics. You know… the people who look at data and can tell us that one number is higher than the other (great work, guys). How do we do it? Let’s go deeper into my conversation with Tim. Mister Piotroski Meets Mister Graham Sign up for SMS so you never miss special events, exclusive offers, and weekly bonus trades. Joseph Piotroski is an accounting professor at Stanford University. Before that, he taught at the University of Chicago. He created something called the F score. This nine-point score analyzes the health and strength of a company’s balance sheet. If the company meets the following criteria, it receives a point for each. A “9” is a perfect score. Positive Net Income. Positive return on assets in the current year. Positive operating cash flow in the current year. Cash flow from operations is greater than net Income. Lower ratio of long-term debt in the current period compared to the previous year. Higher current ratio this year compared to the previous year. No new shares were issued in the last year. A higher gross margin compared to the previous year. A higher asset turnover ratio compared to the previous year. A company with a 9 out of 9 has an executive board that is extremely shareholder friendly and interested in boosting shareholder value. Meanwhile, Ben Graham is the godfather of value investing. He’s the man who influenced some of the world’s best long-term investors: Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger… and David Dodd (who worked with Graham at Columbia Business School). Graham and Dodd identified one anomaly that can’t be arbitraged away - regardless of how many machines trade in this market… “Value.” That’s a subject that Tim knows a lot about. Value investing is about deriving the “intrinsic value” of a company’s stock independent of the actual company’s price. So, what does Tim do with his time? He looks at a company’s assets, earnings, and dividend payouts independent of whatever the stock trades for today. So, we use another important metric. Graham developed something called the Graham number. This figure calculates a stock’s underlying value by analyzing a company’s earnings per share (EPS) and book value per share (BVPS). By default, it creates an upside number that a shareholder should be willing to pay as a defensive investment. Stocks trading at deep discounts to this number can be a unique value. But it’s not enough by itself. In 1987, Warren Buffett wrote something that altered my thinking about the markets. In a letter to shareholders, he said, “We are quite content to hold any security indefinitely, so long as the prospective return on equity capital of the underlying business is satisfactory, management is competent and honest, and the market does not overvalue the business.” Here we find Piotroski's accounting analysis shows us the importance of competent management and an improving return on equity capital. And we see the importance of Graham and Dodd’s analysis to help us recognize if the market is over or under-valuing a stock. Mister Graham, Do Your Dance In 2016, two academics released a study that said, “fundamental signals derived from financial statements allow for future abnormal stock returns.” The article was called “Separating winners from losers: Composite indicators based on fundamentals in the European context.” The authors are Borja Amor-Tapia and Maria T. Tascón from the Universidad de León. What did it uncover? I’ll cut to the chase… You want to buy stocks with strong F scores, cheap Price-to-Graham numbers, and other healthy metrics or other metrics that offer a turnaround-like potential. These offers are stocks with a very nice floor and immense upside for a bounce back. You’d likely be surprised that the stocks on today’s list include housing, energy, mining, and shipping. These companies are incentivizing shareholders to stick around – F scores are strong. Balance sheets are strong. Debt is likely low. Putting This into Action In January, I recommended that readers take a stake in SkyWest Inc. (SKYW). The company is a regional operator of domestic airlines – and caters to larger players in the industry. Think puddle jumpers. Now, I warned that the risk for the company centered around the challenges associated with retaining and hiring new pilots. But at the time, shares were trading at an extremely low Graham number, and it had an F score of 8. And what happened next? SkyWest (SKYW) increased by 107.3% year-to-date, which is better than the YTD performances of Alphabet (GOOGL), Apple (AAPL), and Amazon (AMZN) (all three are up roughly 40% to 50% this year). If we can buy a handful of these names – and have just one or two beat the market, we could see a portfolio that guides us well in 2023.

A Multi-Time Frame Reviewby John Chang, Benzinga Contributor June 7, 2023 10:02 AM |  4 min read Not to toot my own horn, but I first wrote about the critical 4200 level breakthrough that markets needed to see in order for a bigger move to occur. That article was published May 26th, here's the link:Will the S&P 500 Break Out of 4200 Level? Charts Suggests Possibility Is FavorableAs of writing the article, on June 6th, the index closed 4283 and seemingly we are close to breaking the 4300 levels soon. Before we go through the charts, what are the top three primary factors driving this rally?1. Corporate Earnings:Corporate earnings have generally been strong, surpassing expectations in many cases. As businesses recover and consumer demand rebounds, companies across various sectors are reporting robust financial results. These positive earnings reports are driving investor sentiment and attracting more capital to the stock markets. Just this past earnings season we saw Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL Meta Platforms META just to name a few exceeded expectations. Moreover, technological advancements and innovation continue to play a crucial role in market growth. Companies at the forefront of technology, such as those in the digital transformation, e-commerce, and renewable energy sectors, are experiencing significant growth and attracting investor attention.2. Moderating InflationInflation is a persistent rise in the general level of prices in an economy over a sustained period. It is a complex economic phenomenon that can have significant effects on businesses, consumers, and overall economic stability. Understanding the causes of inflation is crucial for policymakers, investors, and individuals alike. We have seen a significant downturn in headline CPI data for the last 12 months: 3. Markets Pricing In Rate Pause & High EmploymentOne primary objective of the Fed is to maintain price stability. If inflationary pressures are rising and there is a concern that prices may accelerate beyond the desired target, the Fed may opt to raise interest rates. By increasing rates, borrowing becomes more expensive, which can moderate spending and dampen inflationary pressures. The Feds also monitors the labor market closely. If employment levels reach or exceed full employment, where the majority of individuals who want jobs have them, the Fed may consider raising rates to prevent the economy from overheating. Higher interest rates can help prevent excessive wage growth and maintain a stable labor market. Lastly, Feds is responsible for promoting the stability of the financial system. If there are concerns about excessive risk-taking, speculative bubbles, or imbalances in the financial markets, the Fed may increase interest rates as a precautionary measure. It's expected as of today, there will be a 83% chance of the Feds pausing rate hikes at least for June FOMC:Lastly, if we view the trend on Employment since Covid, it is even more clear to see why the market is breaking through resistances:Now, on to the charts dated end of day June 6th, 2023. Daily Timeframe:Green Line: 200DMA Yellow: 50DMA Orange: 20DMAContructive to say the least for number of reasons. The daily MACD oscillator has truned green over the last several days and the momentum seems toe carry over last serveral days even after blowing past 4200. My short term (end of summer) target is little under 4400, which corresponds with a trendline in WHITE below from October Lows. Likely pull backs will come, as long as index stays above the 20D (4178), we are still in an uptrend. A break down of the 20DMA I expect 50DMA to hold 4134. Weekly Timeframe:While I am bullish for the summer, I'm looking for some backtest of weekly 20DMA in orange at 4101. Why? So far this week, we are trading in a very tight range. We'll have to assess again at week's end. However, starting to run out of steam if we cannot close above 4300 this week. If we do, our summer end's target of 4400 is in view. Monthly Timeframe:Perhaps the most bullish timeframe is the index monthly chart. For one, MACD is flipping cross 0 line. We closed the month of May above the 20MA which was critical for me personally to see a susutained uptrend. If you look back to the 20DMA April 2020, that was the month the index closed above the 20MA. Subsequently we saw one of history's greatest bullrun! As of this writing, monthly candle tested the 20MA and showing strength. Long month to go as market awaits next round of CPI Data, and FOMC rate decision. For more trading signals, education, visit www.therocktradingco.com or sign up for our newsletter here.© 2023 Benzinga.com.

Last Updated: June 7, 2023 at 10:49 a.m. ET First Published: June 7, 2023 at 9:51 a.m. ET By Emily Bary comments Wedbush is upbeat about the iPhone 15 cycle and Apple’s ability to win more investor praise for its services momentum Wedbush sees upside potential come the next iPhone cycle. AFP via Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement AAPL +0.01% A big Apple Inc. bull just got more upbeat. Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives boosted his price target on Apple shares AAPL, +0.01% to $220 from $205 Wednesday, with his new target now the highest among those tracked by FactSet. The stock recently changed hands just above $179. Ives was optimistic about Apple heading into the iPhone 15 cycle. “Our recent Asia supply chain checks give us further incremental confidence that this upcoming iPhone 15 product cycle could be another trophy case moment for Cupertino kicking off this fall with expected units and ASPs [average selling prices] that could yet another easily surpass current Street expectations,” he wrote in a note to clients.  See also: Apple could be cooking up 3 more $10 billion-plus businesses, one analyst says The company enters the period with a “massive position of strength” in his view, thanks to strong demand for the more expensive Pro-level models, including in the crucial China market. “The initial iPhone units bogey for FY24 looks to be in the ~235 million unit range and we would expect an upside bias,” Ives commented.  Don’t miss: Apple wants its Vision Pro to mark a computing revolution. Early testers say it’s still just a fancy headset. Beyond iPhones lies a compelling narrative around services, he noted. The company will get closer to the $100-billion mark for annual services revenue come fiscal 2024 (FactSet estimates call for $92 billion), which Ives said would be up substantially from just above $50 billion in fiscal 2020.  “Herein lies the key to the valuation re-rating that we believe will continue to take place around Apple’s stock as the Street further appreciates the sheer massive potential of this services revenue that we now assign a valuation in the $1.4 trillion range,” Ives wrote. “We believe Apple’s fair valuation could be in the $3.5 trillion range with a bull case $4 trillion valuation by FY25.” Apple has been hovering above a $2.8 trillion market capitalization.

By Adam Levy – Jun 7, 2023 at 9:40AM Key Points Shares of Apple hit an all-time high ahead of its WWDC announcements. Shares trade at a relatively high P/E multiple for Apple. But the shares may still be worth it for investors. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More $3,499 is a lot for a mixed-reality headset, but is $3 trillion too much for the stock? There were audible groans and boos when Apple (AAPL 1.56%) revealed the price of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset will be $3,499. But few investors are balking at the price of Apple stock, which is once again flirting with a $3 trillion market cap. Shares of Apple hit an all-time high price ahead of Apple's big announcement earlier this week at its World Wide Developers Conference (WWDC) in California. The shares have outperformed both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite indexes by a wide margin year to date. Meanwhile, its valuation is touching levels not seen since the end of 2021, when it last sat near $3 trillion, despite an outlook for a revenue and earnings decline in 2023. Is Apple getting too expensive for both investors and consumers? A hefty price tag Apple shares peaked above a forward P/E ratio of 30 to start the month of June. That's a higher forward P/E than the last time Apple shares traded around the $3 trillion market cap mark. The culprit is expectations that Apple's revenue and earnings per share will decline over the next year. Analysts currently expect a 2.3% decline in EPS and a 2.5% decline in sales for Apple. The Vision Pro won't sway those numbers: The device won't come out until 2024 and probably won't have meaningful sales until fiscal 2025. Over the last 15 years, Apple shares have traded at a trailing P/E above 30 for nine months during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic and then briefly again near the end of 2021. With its current P/E of 30.4, it's starting to look quite pricey again. AAPL P/E Ratio data by YCharts. Is Apple worth it? Despite its high price tags, Apple's products (and its stock) are typically worth the price. While the Vision Pro's value may still be up for debate, the stock still looks like a good deal despite the P/E ratio climbing above 30. Apple's stock price is supported by the pile of cash sitting on its balance sheet. As of the end of the second quarter, Apple had $166 billion in cash and securities on its balance sheet. While it used debt to access that cash, it still had just $107 billion in debt on the balance sheet, leaving it with $59 billion in net cash. Meanwhile, it's generated nearly $100 billion in free cash flow over the past year, and the outlook remains strong for it to keep the cash machine running. That consistent cash flow and massive stockpile on its balance sheet gives Apple a lot of room to keep buying back shares of the stock and support its stock price. It bought back $39 billion worth of stock in the first half of 2023, and the board authorized a new $90 billion share repurchase program in May. The consistent sales of iPhones and the growth of Apple's high-margin services business are the reasons to buy Apple. It's a cash cow that allows it to return massive amounts of money to shareholders while still investing in products for the future, like Vision Pro. So, even if Vision Pro is an absolute overpriced flop (which I don't think is the case, for the record), Apple will walk away largely unscathed. Even at today's high price, Apple stock is worth buying. Adam Levy has positions in Apple. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Apple. The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy.

The upcoming iPhone 15 product cycle could be another trophy case moment for Cupertino, with expected units and Average Selling Prices (ASPs) that could easily surpass current Street expectations.The Apple Analyst: Ives is raising his price target from $205 to $220 to reflect increased confidence in this upcoming iPhone cycle and reiterates Apple as an “Outperform” and Wedbush Best Ideas List name.See Also: Should I Buy iPhone 14 Or Wait For iPhone 15The Apple Thesis: Based on Ives’ analysis, approximately 250 million iPhones have not been upgraded in over 4 years, setting Apple up for a major installed base upgrade cycle heading into this anniversary 15-year release. With more Apple customers heading down the Pro path, especially in China, Ives believes ASPs could start to approach the ~$925 level for the iPhone 15 cycle, up roughly $100 in the last 18 months.As reported previously, Apple’s Vision Pro mixed reality headset, priced at a hefty $3,499 and expected to hit the market early next year, is not expected to be a problem. Ives suggests that the headset's capability to integrate gaming, video streaming, conferencing, and health/fitness apps across Apple's ecosystem positions it as a revolutionary product that could potentially outpace competitors.The iPhone 15 lineup is rumored to feature the world's thinnest screen bezels, a ""dynamic island"" feature for quick access to frequently used apps, the A17 Bionic chipset, enhanced HD photography capabilities, and a switch to solid-state buttons from physical ones. Ives forecasts that by fiscal year 2024, Apple’s annual services revenue is expected to be near $100 billion, with a double-digit growth rate. He believes this growth trajectory is crucial for the ongoing re-evaluation of Apple’s stock value. Apple Price Action: Apple stock traded 0.2% higher at $178.82 in the premarket session on Wednesday. Hi, I am the Benzinga Newsbot!

Apple is venturing into augmented reality, climbing to the top of a high-growth market. Meanwhile, Costco is rapidly expanding its locations worldwide. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services.

Learn More These companies have a history of offering investors solid gains, with coming developments signaling countless growth opportunities. Summer is just around the corner, which often triggers a stock market slump. While sluggishly performing stocks could convince you it's time to sell, keeping a long-term perspective during the warmer months is crucial. The market often rebounds once the air turns chilly, and you won't want to miss out on potential gains. In the meantime, it's a good idea to strengthen your portfolio by investing in companies with a history of growth. Companies like Apple (AAPL 1.56%) and Costco (COST 0.71%) have provided investors with consistent gains for years and have excellent outlooks for 2023. These are two of the best hot stocks to buy in June. 1. Apple Apple stock hit an all-time high on June 5 ahead of its Worldwide Developers Conference, thanks to anticipation for the debut of its first augmented reality (AR) headset, which it calls the Vision Pro. The company's shares gained 2% in the early hours of the day, hitting a record $184.90 by midday. The stock lost steam later in the day, falling to $179 a share after Apple announced the headset's eye-watering price of $3,499. However, the downturn doesn't dampen the company's massive potential in AR. Apple shares didn't tumble because its headset lacked innovation, merely because its price doesn't allow it to appeal to the mass market just yet. As a result, an investment in Apple now is not for the success of the current Vision Pro, but for what's possible three or four generations down the line when the price is naturally reduced, making the technology more available to the average consumer. Data from Market Research Future reveals the AR market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 42% through 2030. Meanwhile, Apple's new headset is unlike anything else available, with its advanced capabilities potentially propelling it to the top of the industry. The company has much to gain as the sector develops. Apple's Vision Pro looks to be just the beginning of where AR is headed, with now an excellent time to consider buying this hot stock. 2. Costco As grocery retailers go, Costco is one of the most reliable investment options available. The company's stock has climbed 160% in the last five years. Meanwhile, its annual revenue and operating income have risen over 60% in the same period. The wholesale retailer's unique strategy of selling bulk items at low prices to consumers who are paying an annual membership fee for the privilege has won over shoppers worldwide. In fact, the company's membership renewal rate hit 93% in the U.S. and Canada and 90% internationally in 2022. Costco currently operates in 14 countries, granting it significant growth opportunities. In France alone, the company has opened two stores since 2017. Its success in the country has led to plans to open 15 additional locations by 2025. With similar potential in many other countries, Costco shares will likely continue climbing for years. Moreover, easing inflation suggests it's not a bad idea to add a retail stock to your list of holdings. Companies in the industry have the most to gain from the improving cost of living, with now an excellent time to invest before it's too late. Costco is one of the best options, thanks to its past gains in the stock market, compared to peers. The chart below illustrates how Costco's stock growth over the last five years is between double and triple the growth of its biggest competitors. Data by YCharts. As Costco continues to expand its global presence and other areas of its business, like its e-commerce division, the company has much to offer investors. Alongside a dividend that has increased for 19 consecutive years, Costco stock is a no-brainer buy this June.

And No, It's Not the Metaverse. By Adria Cimino – Jun 7, 2023 at 6:00AM Key Points This week, Apple announced what may be its next big device: its first spatial computer. The new device may represent a turning point for the company. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NASDAQ: AAPL Apple Market Cap $2,891B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.56%) $2.83 Current Price $183.79 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More Cook considers Vision Pro ""a huge leap"" into an important technology. Apple's (AAPL 1.56%) history is marked by exciting launches that have transformed the company -- and maybe your lifestyle too. I'm thinking of products like the iPhone or the iPad. But it's been a while since the innovative tech company has unveiled a new game-changing product. The last one actually was the Apple Watch back in 2014. However, the wait may be over. The company announced Vision Pro at its developers conference earlier this week. In an interview with Good Morning America, Apple chief executive officer Tim Cook referred to the device as ""tomorrow's engineering, today."" But Apple isn't calling Vision Pro a step into the metaverse. Instead, Apple is focusing on the idea of spatial computing. Could this be Apple's next big thing? Making your movie screen 100 feet wide First, some details about the device: It's a headset that allows wearers to see apps, messages, and more within their environment. Users can launch a search through a simple voice command and scroll through items with a tap of a finger. Vision Pro promises to make your movie screen feel 100 feet wide -- right there in your living room. Users also can look at their own photos and videos at life-size scale. And those are just a couple of examples of what this new device can do. Users feel as if they're really in the middle of the action as they watch movies, TV programs, or sporting events, Cook said on Good Morning America. So, it's an exciting moment for technology fans. But it also is an exciting moment for Apple. Vision Pro is the ""most advanced piece of electronics equipment out there,"" Cook said during the interview. He called augmented reality a ""profound technology"" that Apple has been working on for a while. ""This is the next chapter in that, and it's a huge leap,"" the CEO said. It's clear that the product is a major innovation. But the question now is whether it will stand out as Apple's previous innovations have done -- and how it may impact revenue. Vision Pro comes with a hefty price tag: at least $3,499, the company says. That's compared to Meta Platforms' Quest 3 that should launch later this year for $499. Budget-conscious technology fans may opt for the Meta product. Even if the Apple product is superior, it may be difficult to sell Vision Pro to a wide audience at such a price level. That said, at this price, Apple may not need a huge audience. My colleague Nicholas Rossolillo wrote about how Apple just needs to sell 1.9 million Vision Pro devices to equal the iPad's revenue from last quarter. This means Vision Pro could become Apple's next big thing -- even if it doesn't attract a huge audience. A key step for Apple And, right now, Vision Pro is a key step for Apple because it brings the company into a new era of technology. It's still too early to say whether this device will be a stepping stone for Apple in spatial computing, or if it will truly take off. But Apple's strong device track record is good reason to be optimistic about the company's position in spatial computing over the long term. One key point to watch is the pace of development of applications for Vision Pro. Apple's developer community can harness the power of Vision Pro to create new app experiences, for example. Whether Vision Pro immediately brings revenue growth to Apple or not, all of this means it still could be yet another game-changing device for the company.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research The Role of Technology in Mastercard's Growth By Rob Starks Jr – Jun 7, 2023 at 6:00AM Key Points Mastercard has a strong track record of finding payment and technology trends early. The company faces enormous competition and must continuously innovate to stay relevant. Mastercard has recently made strategic acquisitions to expand its global reach and capabilities. Motley Fool Issues Rare “All In” Buy Alert NYSE: MA Mastercard Market Cap $355B Today's Change Arrow-Thin-Down (1.65%) $6.09 Current Price $375.31 Price as of June 12, 2023, 4:00 p.m. ET You’re reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool’s Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More This payment processor is at the forefront of developing new technology. Although established a lifetime ago in 1966, Mastercard (MA 1.65%) is far from an outdated credit card company. On the contrary, it stands out among the world's most advanced financial technology (fintech) enterprises. It leverages cutting-edge technology to deliver innovative payment solutions globally to consumers, merchants, financial institutions, and governments. Here's a look at how Mastercard is taking the lead in developing new payment technologies, as well as positioning itself for growth. As a result, it will be challenging for new fintech competitors to unseat Mastercard in the payments industry. It catches on to the latest payment trends early The company employs experts who constantly monitor the ever-evolving payments landscape and quickly identify emerging trends. Mastercard also partners with various organizations, including financial institutions, merchants, and governments, to remain on the cutting edge and be among the first to establish itself in many lucrative areas of the payment industry. Here are some payment trends that Mastercard discovered early: Increased use of contactless card payments.Mastercard was one of the first companies to offer contactless payments in 2008, well before contactless payments became popular during the COVID-19 pandemic due to consumers viewing them as safer and cleaner than cash. During its latest earnings report, Mastercard Chief Executive Office Michael Miebach said, ""Over 100 markets have reached at least 50% contactless penetration, double the number three years ago."" The growth of mobile payments.The company has partnered with several mobile payment providers, such as Apple Pay and Alphabet's Google Pay, to make it easier for customers to make payments with their smartphones. Its latest innovation, Tap on Phone, enables businesses to approve payments from any contactless card or a mobile wallet using a device capable of near-field communication, making it easier for businesses of all sizes to accept contactless payments. The proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) in payments.Mastercard is a leader in harnessing artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the payment process. It uses AI in various ways, including fraud detection, customer service, and marketing. The company has invested heavily in AI and is collaborating with multiple partners to develop new payment solutions aided by AI. Central banks creating digital currencies.The company is a leader in creating solutions that can help central banks launch and manage a central bank digital currency (CBDC) for the public to use in day-to-day payments. Many governments would like to replace cash with CBDC. Mastercard has many experts working on various CBDC-related projects, including developing new payment rails, building new security features, and creating new compliance solutions. One word of caution Despite its considerable advantages as a first mover in many lucrative areas of the payments industry, Mastercard faces significant competition from various players in the market, including payment processors such as Visa (V 1.17%) and Stripe and online payment companies like PayPal (PYPL 0.38%) and Block (SQ -1.14%). This competition poses a major risk to the company, and if it ever needs to lower its fees to remain competitive, that could result in decreased profits. Additionally, Mastercard may lose market share if competitors offer better products or services, leading to lower revenue. The company counters competition by continuing to innovate to stay ahead. If any expertise is too expensive or will take too long to develop in-house, Mastercard will acquire companies with the technology. Some exciting acquisitions In recent years, Mastercard has made many tuck-in acquisitions to acquire exciting technology that helps keep it at the forefront of the payment industry's technological battles. A tuck-in acquisition is a small, strategic acquisition that complements an existing business. One of the most important acquisitions was Aiia, a developer-first open banking technology. Open banking allows third-party financial providers, such as fintechs and personal financial management (PFM) apps, to access consumers' bank financial data, giving them more control and access to new and innovative financial services -- a potentially huge business. Some of these services include personalized financial advice, such as recommendations for investments or savings products, while PFM apps allow users to view their financial data from all their accounts in one place, helping them track spending, discover ways to save money, and better understand their overall financial health. Additionally, third-party providers can use this data to facilitate faster, more convenient account-to-account payments, which are superior to traditional methods such as checks or wire transfers. Allied Market Research valued the global open banking market size at $13.9 billion in 2020. It expects this market to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.3% from 2023 to 2031 to $123.7 billion. Next, Mastercard's recent acquisition of Baffin Bay Networks is another excellent step in the company's multilayered approach to security. Baffin Bay Networks is an AI-enabled automated cloud-based security service that can stop cyberattacks related to malware, ransomware, and distributed denial of service (DDoS) attacks. This acquisition will allow Mastercard to provide its customers with even greater security and peace of mind. Last, the purchase of Dynamic Yield was yet another vital acquisition for Mastercard. Acquiring Dynamic Yield will help the company strengthen its personalization capabilities and better compete with other payment technology companies. The platform uses AI to deliver personalized customer experiences that its clients can use to personalize websites, mobile apps, email marketing campaigns, and other customer touchpoints -- a wide range of businesses already use the platform, including McDonald's, Deckers Brands, and Sephora. Does its technology provide a reason to buy the stock? Mastercard's payment technology gives the company a competitive advantage. Its payment processing network is one of the most secure and efficient in the world. Moreover, throughout its history, it has committed to innovation and looking for new ways to better its services to exceed customer expectations. As a result, its technology gives investors many compelling reasons to consider buying the stock. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Reuters June 07, 2023 / 06:11 AM IST US stocks end up as Fed, CPI loom large next week   U.S. stocks closed up on Tuesday, helped by some advances in economically sensitive sectors, as investors awaited inflation data and the Federal Reserve's policy meet next week.Inflation data is expected to show consumer prices cooled slightly on a month-over-month basis in May but core prices are likely to have remained elevated, and the Fed is widely expected to hold interest rates.Major indexes wavered as investors took a breather after pushing the S&P 500 up almost 20% from its October 2022 lows, boosted by gains in megacap stocks, a stronger-than-expected earnings season and hopes that the U.S. central bank is nearing the end of its interest rate-hike cycle.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI) rose 10.42 points, or 0.03%, to 33,573.28, the S&P 500 (.SPX) gained 10.06 points, or 0.24%, to 4,283.85 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC) added 46.99 points, or 0.36%, to 13,276.42.""It looks like investors are gaining a little optimism,"" said Cresset Capital CIO Jack Ablin.

The Russell 2000 index (.RUT) of small-cap companies added 2.69%.Recent economic data and dovish remarks from Fed officials have raised the odds of the Fed holding interest rates at its June 13-14 meeting.Fed fund futures indicate traders have priced in a near 80% chance that the central bank will hold interest rates in the 5%-5.25% range, according to CMEGroup's Fedwatch tool. However, they see 50% odds of another 25-basis-point rate hike in July.Coinbase Global (COIN.O) plunged 12.09% after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission sued the crypto exchange, accusing it of illegally operating without having first registered with the regulator.Apple Inc (AAPL.O) extended losses to slip 0.21%, a day after the iPhone maker unveiled a costly augmented-reality headset called the Vision Pro, barging into a market dominated by Meta (META.O).Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) rose 5.34% after Piper Sandler raised the price target on the stock to $150, the second highest on Wall Street, as per Refinitiv data.Advancing issues outnumbered declining ones on the NYSE by a 3.47-to-1 ratio; on Nasdaq, a 2.59-to-1 ratio favored advancers.The S&P 500 posted 17 new 52-week highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq Composite recorded 98 new highs and 69 new lows.

Companies known as Big Tech, including Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.03%, Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.88%, Google parent Alphabet Inc. GOOG, +0.81%, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.32%, Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.36%, Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. META, +1.12% and Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.64%, now represent 27.4% of the S&P 500 after soaring in 2023, a DataTrek note Tuesday shows. These “seven stocks are just over a quarter of the S&P after starting the year as one-fifth of the index,” Nicholas Colas, co-founder of DataTrek, wrote in the note. “One might have convincingly argued that even 20 percent was too high a weighting, but that has not stopped this cohort from gobbling up even more S&P 500 ‘market share’.” Big Tech has “gained 7.4 points of S&P 500 weighting” in 2023, exceeding the weighting of the index’s entire large-cap energy sector,  according to the note. The energy sector weighs in at 4.2% of the S&P 500.  Meanwhile, the amount of Big Tech’s added weight this year is also about triple the 2.5% the materials sector represents in the index, said Colas. Shares of Big Tech companies have skyrocketed this year against “an otherwise standstill U.S. equity market,” driving the S&P 500’s gains, according to the note. The index, which is a gauge of large-cap stocks in the U.S., has climbed 11.6% this year through Tuesday.  The S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% closed slightly higher Tuesday, remaining on the cusp of breaking out of its bear market as the index is nearly 20% above its closing low last year in October.  Read: Why the broader U.S. stock market has ‘a lot riding’ on Big Tech earnings “There’s nothing inherently wrong with a market that chooses to only reward some combination of cost cutting and new technology, but it is far from either the norm or the ideal setup,” said Colas.  While the rest of the S&P 500 may be starting to benefit from “stabilizing” expectations for company earnings against the backdrop of still “reasonably strong” economic growth, as well as from “incremental clarity” over the past few weeks on the debt ceiling and the Federal Reserve’s upcoming policy meetings this month and July, “we will want to see more proof before being convinced of its permanence.” Seven of the S&P 500’s 11 sectors rose Tuesday, with financials posting the strongest performance with a sharp gain of 1.3%, according to FactSet data. While Big Tech is trading at an average 44.2x the group’s forward 12-month earnings, the S&P 500’s much smaller energy sector trades for 10x forward earnings while the materials sector is valued at 15.8x, according to DataTrek.  Big Tech valuations are “high,” said Colas, with Apple, Microsoft and Alphabet and Meta being “somewhat high” while Amazon, Nvidia and Tesla are “extremely high.” Advertisement Advertisement Partner Center Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Advertisement Most Popular Advertisement U.S. stock futures point higher after May inflation data meets forecasts Inflation slows again, CPI shows, and might keep Fed on sidelines Apple’s stock is no longer worth buying after reaching a record, says Wall Street firm How to invest in art without spending millions of dollars Tesla, Amazon, Ford stocks rise more as tame inflation data gives a boost to consumer discretionary sector Advertisement Advertisement Read Next Read Next Barron's: These Stocks Are Moving the Most Today: Tesla, Carnival, Nasdaq, SoFi, and More Tesla is rising for a 12th consecutive day, Carnival trades higher after Wall Street upgrades the stock, and Nasdaq falls after agreeing to acquire software company Adenza for $10.5 billion in cash and shares.

Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images Email icon Facebook icon Twitter icon Linkedin icon Flipboard icon Print icon Resize icon Referenced Symbols Advertisement MSFT +0.88% NVDA +1.36% AAPL -0.02% AMZN +0.32% TSLA +1.65% SPX +0.50% SP500.40 -0.09% SP500.20 +0.69% SP500.50 +1.20% SP500.45 +2.07% DJIA +0.34% COMP +0.69% Cyclical value stocks, including shares of companies in the financials, industrials and basic materials sectors will play a catch-up to outperforming megacap technology shares heading into the third quarter of 2023, broadening the stock-market rally and lifting the benchmark S&P 500 index to 4,400, a closely followed Wall Street analyst forecast on Tuesday. “Most gains since October 2022 were cyclical growth, technology, for example, but now we see cyclical value such as basic materials, industrials, financials in a catch-up price-to-earnings ratio led rally to the third quarter of 2023, which broadens the market while limiting cap-weighted index upside,” said Barry Bannister, chief equity strategist at Stifel, in a Monday note. The cyclical growth category includes software (Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +0.88% -dominated), semiconductors (Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +1.36% -dominated), tech hardware (Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.02% -dominated), retailing (Amazon.com AMZN, +0.32% -dominated), media, autos (Tesla Inc. TSLA, +1.65% -dominated) and apparels, while the cyclical value category includes banks, materials, transportation, real estate, capital goods and insurance, according to Stifel.  Most of the stock-market gains so far in 2023 have been powered by a handful of tech-focused names, whose weighting in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.50% is at a historically high level. They have helped lift the index higher by 11.6% this year and had it on the verge of exiting its longest bear-market run since 1948. However, a top-heavy concentration usually indicates limited participation and is not sustainable over the long term.  That’s why a “catch-up” rally in cyclical value stocks could help broaden out the stock-market advance, but it will restrict the future upside for the cap-weighted S&P 500 as companies in the cyclical value category only account for 24% of the index, while the cyclical growth represents a notable 44%, Bannister said. Among the 11 sectors of the S&P 500, the financials sector SP500.40, -0.09% has risen 2.1% over the past month, while the industrials sector SP500.20, +0.69% has advanced 1% and the materials sector has shed 1.2% over the same period. At the other end of the spectrum, the communication services SP500.50, +1.20% and information technology sectors SP500.45, +2.07% have jumped over 10%, thanks to robust gains in megacap growth and tech stocks, according to FactSet data.  Strategists at Stifel divide the 24 industries in the S&P 500 into four quadrants based on economic growth, which affects earnings-per-share, versus inflation, which has affected price-to-earnings ratio since 1990. The chart below shows the cyclical growth stocks have been overbought since the start of 2023 when strategists compared their shares with their 50- and 200-day moving averages.  However, stocks in the cyclical value category have been oversold in the same period and are poised to rebound when “global GDP firms, U.S. dollar weakens, and the Federal Reserve officially reaches the end of its interest-rate hiking cycle,” the strategists said. SOURCE: BLOOMBERG DATA, STIFEL ESTIMATES “Since Oct. 24, 2022, we’ve preferred the cyclical quadrants (at right), seeing no near-term recession and high but cooler inflation,” said Bannister.  However, Bannister is still cautious over the longer term as he sees reasons to watch out for a “textbook” recession in late 2023 and flattening earnings growth by year end. The 50-day moving average of the 3M-10Y Treasury yield curve shows recession risk in September 2023, with “no false signals the past 55 years in 8 recessions,” said Bannister (see chart below). SOURCE: BLOOMBERG DATA, STIFEL ESTIMATES “We believe recessions and bear markets are surprises and not so widely anticipated, leaving consensus sentiment since Oct. 2022 off-sides, but risk may indeed rise in 4Q23 and beyond,” said Bannister.  “As the 2023 slowdown proves mild the economy encounters resource constraints late-2023 or 1H24, and because there is no economic reset as sought by the Fed, then between 4Q23 and 2Q24 there may be policy or economic risk.”  U.S. stocks ended higher on Tuesday as investors remained cautious and awaited the May CPI data and Fed’s interest-rate decision due next week. The S&P 500 was up 10 points, or 0.2%, to 4,283, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.34% ended flat and the Nasdaq Composite COMP, +0.69% advanced 0.4%.

Fiverr is down by double-digit percentages over the past year, but looking past the volatility is warranted. Apple saw shares pop nearly 50% just in 2023, and an upcoming launch could help it rise further.

Learn More A bear market could impact these stocks, but likely not for long. Growth stocks aren't boosting investors' returns at the rate they were a few years ago, but it's not all doom and gloom. Great businesses continue to thrive in what is arguably an uncertain macroeconomic environment that has investors divided about what to do with their money. Here are two companies performing well on a business level that beg a second look from investors regarding their stocks. Both of these unstoppable growth stocks look ripe for multi-year buy-and-hold investments in 2023 and beyond. 1. Fiverr International Fiverr International (FVRR 4.74%) got increased attention from investors in the pandemic era when millions of people were forced to stay at home for extended periods which resulted in a notable boom in remote work and gig work. The growth has certainly slowed from that peak pandemic period. Still, there's a lot to like about this stock, particularly when you evaluate its growth story in light of the bigger picture of the industry in which it operates and its progress over the last few years. Fiverr finished out the first quarter of this year with 4.3 million active buyers of freelance services on its platform, and spending per buyer hitting $262 (spending, in this case, is the 5.5% service fee Fiverr collects on top of the fees that go to the seller for services rendered). These two figures represented increases of 0.3% and 4% from the year-ago period. Taking a step back, that active buyer count was up 74% compared to the same quarter in 2020, while spending per buyer rose 48% on a three-year clip. Fiverr continues to expand the vast range of services (gigs) that freelancers can offer to clients and businesses on the platform as well. For example, the rise of AI has pervaded many segments of the labor economy, and the gig economy is no different. Even as searches and offerings for AI-focused gigs have expanded rapidly in recent months, Fiverr's management has been clear that these tools aren't replacing the need for actual gig workers. The first-quarter earnings report noted: We are also seeing higher quality of work deliveries as freelancers leverage the latest generative AI tools. Fiverr's marketplace is highly dynamic. Just as consumer preferences continue to evolve in a physical goods marketplace, on Fiverr, services and job skills continue to evolve as well. When new waves of technology advancements occur, these often are the golden moments for category expansion on our marketplace followed by an influx of supply and demand. We believe the recent advancement of AI technology creates such a golden moment to lean into our category expansion as a long-term growth driver. Between 2019 and 2022, Fiverr's revenue expanded at a compound annual growth rate of 47%. Compare that to the pace of growth of the broader global gig economy, which is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate of 16% in the seven-year period between 2021 and 2028, according to Business Research Insights. It's also worth noting that in 2022, 27% of Fiverr's revenue was from new buyers, while an incredible 63% was from repeat buyers. In short, once a buyer -- whether that be a solo entrepreneur or a large enterprise -- joins the Fiverr platform, they tend to stay with it for a long time. Fiverr's growth journey may be changing, but its business looks more relevant than ever. 2. Apple Apple (AAPL 1.56%) made headlines this week for announcing a significant new hardware product: its eagerly awaited mixed reality headset. The product, officially called the Vision Pro, made its first public appearance at the Worldwide Developers Conference. The headset won't be commercially available until early next year, and it will come with a $3,499 price tag. Vision Pro is a virtual reality headset, an augmented reality headset and it also functions as a 3D camera. Beyond running Apple's app offerings, the headset will be able to integrate with a wide range of third-party apps being created by well-known industry leaders. Microsoft and Walt Disney are just two of the companies building apps to operate on Vision Pro. Users will be able to navigate Microsoft's productivity apps from the headset or stream Disney+ shows. The Vision Pro will also enable pairings with other Apple products. It's powered by Apple's industry-leading M2 chip, and also runs a brand new R1 chip which is designed to reduce the potential for motion sickness. When it's released, Apple hopes to seize a significant share in the highly fragmented multi-billion-dollar virtual reality headset market. According to Fortune Business Insights, the global virtual reality market was valued at about $12 billion in 2021 but is expected to balloon to a valuation of $227 billion by the year 2029. That's a compound annual growth rate of 45%. The company's focus on creating a mixed reality headset that can service a wide range of user needs, rather than focusing on gaming as the primary use case, looks like a solid strategy to capture added market share. Beyond the Vision Pro, Apple announced several other updates this week, including a new Macbook Pro. Importantly, the company still makes most of its revenue from iPhone sales. The second-most-prominent slice of its sales comes from its services segment, which revolves mostly around subscription-based products like Apple Music. Over the trailing 12 months, Apple pulled in revenue of $385 billion and net income of $94 billion. It also produced operating cash flow to the tune of $110 billion. While a challenging macro environment affected Apple's pace of growth, the tech giant is still a highly profitable cash machine that continues to evolve to meet the changing needs of its customers while generating growth from its industry-leading products. The future still looks very exciting for Apple and its long-term shareholders. Rachel Warren has positions in Apple.

June 6, 2023 9:24 AM |  2 min read Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd TSM cut its 2023 capital expenditure outlook to closer to the bottom end of the previously forecast $32 billion - $36 billion range. TSMC reaffirmed projections for revenue in the first half of 2023 to decline by about 10% in U.S. dollar terms, Bloomberg cites Chairman Mark Liu's statement to reporters after hosting the firm's annual shareholders' meeting on Tuesday. The update reflects the critical Apple Inc AAPL supplier's struggle with weak demand for smartphones and computing chips amid an uneven post-Covid Chinese economic recovery. Also Read: What's Going On With Taiwan Semiconductor Stock Tuesday TSMC reaffirmed a low- to mid-single-digit revenue decline in 2023 — about in line with estimates amid the global tech slump and uncertainty over the revival of China's economy. Liu acknowledged undergoing an inventory adjustment period, with recovery in some end markets. TSMC expected its sales to drop slightly in 2023 but is ready to capture substantial growth starting in 2024. Liu discussed TSMC's longer-term prospects while expressing confidence about a broader 2024 sector recovery. The partner to AI chip designer Nvidia Corp NVDA expects a multiplication of AI services on mobile devices driving demand for the advanced chips. TSMC plans to double its advanced chip packaging capacity, Liu told reporters. In 2022, sales from high-performance computing surpassed smartphones for the first time, Liu said. He expected the rise of generative AI to firm up that trend. TSMC has been diversifying its manufacturing footprint over the past two years to mitigate customer concerns over geopolitical uncertainties in the Taiwan Strait. Price Action: TSM shares closed lower by 0.07% at $97.98 premarket on the lat check Tuesday. © 2023 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

The federal government versus the crypto industry. The SEC before the bell Tuesday sues Coinbase (COIN), accusing the company of acting as an unregistered broker and exchange. Coinbase, whose shares sank 20% on the news, did not immediately respond to CNBC's request for comment. 2. The action taken by the top U.S. securities regulator comes one day after it sued Binance and founder Changpeng Zhao, alleging the comingling of funds. The SEC also says Binance used market-making firms it controlled to inflate trading prices and profit off of their customers. Binance dismissed the charges. 3. Price target boosts on Wall Street for Club name Apple (AAPL) after the tech giant unveiled a new mixed-reality headset. While keeping their buy-rating equivalents, Wells Fargo goes to $210 per share from $185 and Credit Suisse goes to $200 from $188. Others are not as positive: Deutsche Bank cites hefty $3,499 starting price for Vision Pro. DA Davidson says the device is already priced into the stock. 4. We see it differently, looking at the promise of the headset not really being about the headset. Ahead of Monday's Vision Pro announcement, Apple shares hit an all-time high. The headset was the ""one more thing"" at Apple's developers conference kickoff presentation. The stock, however, turned lower by the end of the session. 5. Bank of America says to hold Molson Coors (TAP) amid the Bud Light boycott. Boosts price target on TAP to $68 per share from $54. In beer, we own and like Corona and Modelo maker Constellation Brands (STZ). In a recent commentary, we argued the case for STZ over TAP . Jefferies increases STZ price target to $293 from $285; keeps buy rating. 6. Dollar General (DG) downgraded by Wells Fargo to equal weight from overweight (hold from buy). Cuts price target to $165 per share from $178. Amazing how much this one is now hated after a train wreck of a quarter. I think cost-conscience consumers are going to Walmart (WMT) and Club name Costco (COST) 7. The Dow , the S & P 500 and the Nasdaq are set for a relatively flat open; one week out from the start of the Fed's two-day June meeting. Friday's strong jobs report did little to steer market odds away for an interest rate hike pause next week, according to the CME's FedWatch tool. 8. Chances for a Fed rate increase in July stands at roughly 52% in favor. May inflation data is out next week while Fed policymakers gather to deliberate monetary policy. Questions remain whether the Fed has done enough already to tamp down inflation and cool the labor market, or whether there's more to do. 9. Spice maker McCormick (MKC) gets a double upgrade to buy from underperform (sell) at Bank of America, which also boosts price target to $100 per share from $75. Cites improved outlook for costs and margins as well as easier year-over-year volume comps. Meanwhile, Campbell Soup (CPB) posts solid topline quarterly growth. 10. Atlantic Equities starts FedEx (FDX) with an overweight (buy) rating and $265 per share price target, citing cost-cutting and a move to ""flexible, margin enhancing."" JPMorgan is more cautious, lowering its PT to $228 from $233 and keeping its neutral rating. Still a self-help situation. Earnings are due out later this month.

Log In Help Join The Motley Fool Latest Stock Picks Free Article Join Over Half a Million Premium Members And Get More In-Depth Stock Guidance and Research Can Apple's New VR Headset Reignite the Metaverse Buzz? By Nicholas Rossolillo – Jun 6, 2023 at 8:28AM Key Points Apple just announced its mixed reality device Vision Pro, available in 2024 for $3,499. Apple brought along a couple of key partners in Disney and Unity Software that will help fill up Apple's content pipeline. At such a steep price point, Vision Pro may not spark renewed mainstream interest in the metaverse, but it could still be a profitable addition to the Apple family.

Learn More Apple enters the virtual 3D world industry, and (sort of) brings some competition to Meta's Quest headsets. Apple's (AAPL 1.56%) upcoming product, the first new device category launch since the Apple Watch was announced in 2014, was no closely held secret. Rumors have been abundant about development of a virtual reality (VR) or mixed reality headset -- a medium that would bring users into the so-called metaverse, or a 3D rendering of the internet. The wait is over. Vision Pro has been revealed. The only problem is it won't be available until 2024, and it carries a hefty price tag of $3,499. Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META 2.30%) likely feels safe with its own new headset announcement, the Quest 3, available later in 2023 for $499. Nevertheless, Meta's efforts to date haven't set off widespread adoption of the metaverse. Could Apple's VR headset reignite the buzz? Apple's long road to Vision Pro Apple product fans have had to wait a long time since a brand new type of device was introduced. It's been over eight years since Beats Electronics and Beats Music were acquired, and the Apple Watch made its debut. Data source: Apple. Image by author. Over this span of time, Apple's power as a superior investment hasn't diminished, but revenue growth has certainly slowed. Data by YCharts. The timing of Vision Pro is thus timely, and not just because Apple needs another product to fuel growth. The world has changed drastically in the last few years, and digital work and play are now a ubiquitous part of daily life. Thus the desire (from some) for the metaverse, which creates a 3D digital experience that mimics the real world, rather than requiring users to bounce from one screen to another throughout the day. But in the aftermath of the pandemic, there's been pushback against the metaverse and total immersion in digital experiences. Where Meta has failed to gain widespread acceptance, Apple hopes to propel VR to the next level -- much like it did for the smartphone industry in 2007. Vision Pro aims to do this by allowing users to choose how ""immersed"" they are -- from a camera-based portrayal of the space they are in filled in with apps, to a full virtually rendered environment of their choosing. Apple gets some help from partners Video games and entertainment are often the gateway to VR, and Apple is taking a similar approach here. The company showed off how Vision Pro emulates a big screen TV for viewing photos, videos, and TV and movie content. There will also be a new App Store specifically for Vision Pro, Disney (DIS 1.32%) CEO Bob Iger also joined the event to talk up the device. Disney+ will be available on Vision Pro at product launch, as well as interactive content built using Disney's sizable library of IP (from classic Disney animation to Star Wars to the Marvel superhero universe). And on the video game front, Vision Pro developers can tap into video game and 3D content creation platform Unity Software (U -0.85%). Shares of Unity rocketed more than 20% higher on the announcement. Unity's business has been dealing with issues in recent years, so the partnership was viewed as a positive development for the software company. Apple says other companies are developing 3D apps for Vision Pro for play and work, including Microsoft's Office work suite and Adobe's creativity, design, and content editing software. The Apple advantage Many of the features on Vision Pro aren't exactly new. Meta has already released some sort of iteration of most of the capabilities on Apple's headset. In fact, one could argue that Vision Pro's need to remain plugged in throughout the day, or rely on a battery that provides only up to two hours of use, is a serious hindrance. Meta's current-gen headset, Quest 2, has been rated at two to three hours of battery life (Quest 3 battery life details haven't been released yet). Nevertheless, though Meta has more than 3.8 billion monthly active users via its social media apps (Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp), that hasn't translated to widespread headset sales. Apple, on the other hand, has a global installed base of more than 2 billion devices in operation. And therein lies the real Apple advantage, in my opinion. Apple users are fans, they're locked into a large ecosystem of existing devices spanning PCs to phones to earbuds and watches, and they regularly refresh these devices with a new purchase. An increasing number of businesses are adopting Apple hardware too. It wouldn't take many of these devoted fans and businesses making a Vision Pro purchase to jump-start a successful new device segment for Apple -- especially not when each headset costs $3,499 a pop! At full price, it would take only 1.9 million Vision Pro sales to match revenue from the iPad last quarter (Apple reportedly shipped about 10.8 million iPads in Q1 calendar year 2023, bringing in revenue of $6.67 billion). But will Vision Pro rekindle the metaverse buzz? Probably not at its steep price point. Vision Pro could be a nice profitable addition to the Apple family that can reward shareholders, but the world still feels years away from mainstream mixed reality device adoption. For now, this seems like a virtual experience for a select group of early adopters, more than a watershed moment like the iPhone was.
